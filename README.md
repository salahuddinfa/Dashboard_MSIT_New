## Note 1 Accounting principles

Elekta AB (Parent Company), with corporate registration number 556170-4015, is a public limited company and its shares are listed on Nasdaq Stockholm, Sweden. Elekta AB is the Parent Company of the Group (Elekta) and is headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden. The address to the head office is Elekta AB, Hagaplan 4, Box 7593, SE-113 68 Stockholm. This annual report, including the consolidated financial statements, was signed and approved for publication by the Board of Directors of Elekta AB on July 4, 2024. The statements of income and the balance sheets, for the Parent Company and the Group, included in the annual report and the consolidated financial statements, are subject to adoption by the Annual General Meeting on September 5, 2024. The most important accounting principles applied in the preparation of the financial reports are set out below and, where applicable, in the following notes. Mainly, the same principles are applied for the Parent Company and the Group. The Parent Company's accounting principles deviating from those applied by the Group, or considered important to describe, are stated under a separate heading at the end of this note.

### Basis for preparation
Elekta's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the European Union (EU), the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and standard RFR 1 of the Swedish Corporate Reporting Board. The Parent Company's financial reports have been prepared in accordance with the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and standard RFR 2 of the Swedish Corporate Reporting Board.

### Measurement basis
Financial statements have been prepared on a going concern and historical cost basis apart from financial assets and liabilities that are short-term investments, derivatives and contingent considerations, which are recognized at fair value.

### New and amended accounting principles
**Amended IFRS applied from May 1, 2023**

**Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS Practice Statement 2 Making Materiality Judgements – Disclosure of Accounting Policies**  
The amendment and the practice statement provide guidance and examples to materiality judgements to accounting policy disclosures. Accounting principles presented in this report has been adjusted in accordance with the amended guidance.

**Amendment to IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors – Definition of Accounting Estimates**  
The amendments distinguish changes in accounting estimates from changes in accounting policies.

**Amendment to IAS 12 Income Taxes – Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction**  
The amendment clarifies that the initial recognition exemption does not apply on particular transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal amounts of taxable and deductible temporary differences. For the Group, the amendment is only applicable for its leases and has affected the information disclosed in **Note 16 Taxes**.

**Amendment to IAS 12 Income Taxes – International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules**  
The amendments include disclosure requirements of the tax exposure and a temporary exception to recognize and disclose deferred taxes related to Pillar Two Model Rules, which are disclosed in **Note 16 Taxes**.

No other new or amended accounting standards or interpretations effective from 2023 have affected the Group's financial statements.

**New IFRS regulations and interpretations to be applied in 2024 or later**  
From January 1, 2024 amendments in IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements come in to force clarifying when liabilities are to be classified as short-term. Furthermore there have been minor amendments to IFRS 16 Leases for the requirements for sale and leaseback transactions and new disclosure requirements for supplier finance arrangements in IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows and IFRS7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.

From January 1, 2027 IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosures in Financial Statements will be applicable. Elekta is currently evaluating the effects on the financial reporting from new and amended standards.

### Consolidated accounts
The consolidated accounts include Elekta AB and its subsidiaries.

### The acquisition method
The consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with the acquisition method.

### Translation of foreign subsidiaries
The Group companies prepare their financial statements in their functional currency, i.e. the currency used in the primary economic environment in which they mainly operate. These reports provide the basis for the consolidated accounts which are prepared in Swedish kronor (SEK), which is the functional currency of the Parent Company and the presentation currency. Unless otherwise stated, the amounts presented are in millions Swedish krona and, accordingly, rounding differences can occur. All items in the income statements have been translated at the average rate for the reporting period, while assets and liabilities in the balance sheets have been translated at the closing rate.

### Income statement
Elekta presents its income statement classified by function where the operating expenses are allocated to cost of products sold, selling expenses, administrative expenses and R&D expenses. Exchange rate differences are reported on a separate line within the operating income. These have been identified as important to distinguish from operating income and expenses directly related to functions in order to ease comparability over time.

### Transactions and balances in foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currency are translated to the respective Group Company's functional currency by use of the currency rate prevailing on the transaction date. Monetary receivables and liabilities in foreign currency are translated by use of the closing day rate. Exchange rate differences arising upon translation, and upon payment of the transaction, are reported in the income statement with the exception of those related to qualified hedge transactions, related to cash flows or net investments, which are recognized in equity under other comprehensive income.

### Cash flow statement
The cash flow statement is prepared according to the indirect method.

### The Parent Company
The Group's Parent Company, Elekta AB, carries out group management and provides joint group functions and financial management. The Parent Company's revenues consist mainly of dividends from subsidiaries. The most material balance sheet items are shares in subsidiaries, intra-group balances and external loans.

The Parent Company's annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Swedish Annual Accounts Act (1995:1554) and standard RFR 2 of the Swedish Corporate Reporting Board. RFR 2 requires the Parent Company, in its annual accounts, to apply all the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the EU in so far as this is possible within the framework of the Annual Accounts Act and with regard to the relationship between accounting and taxation. RFR 2 states what exceptions from, and additions to, IFRS should be made.

### Revenues
The Parent Company's revenues consist mainly of dividends from subsidiaries. Dividends are recognized when the right to receive payment is judged to be firm.

### Shares in subsidiaries and shares in associates
Shares in subsidiaries and shares in associates are accounted for at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Acquisition-related transaction costs are included in the cost of the shares. The recoverable amount of shares in subsidiaries or shares in associates is calculated whenever there is an indication of a reduction in value. Impairment is performed if the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value. Impairment losses are recognized in the financial net in the income statement.

### Financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments and short-term investments are accounted for at fair value. Changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments are reported in the income statement with the exception of exchange differences related to a monetary item that forms part of a net investment in a foreign subsidiary. Such value changes are recognized in equity under other comprehensive income. Contingent considerations are reported as provisions in the Parent Company.

### Group contributions
Group contributions are reported in accordance with RFR 2. Group contributions received and given are recognized as income from participations in Group companies and increase of shares in subsidiaries respectively. The tax effect of group contributions is recognized in the income statement in accordance with IAS 12.

## Note 2 Financial risk management

### Accounting principles
See Note 4 for accounting principles relating to financial instruments.

### Financial risk factors
As a result of its operations, the Elekta Group is exposed to a number of financial risks: market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group's overriding risk management policy focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce any potentially unfavorable effects on the Group's financial results. Risk management is conducted by the Group's finance department, which identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks. Work is pursued in line with the policies established by the board for overarching risk management and for specific areas such as currency risk, interest-rate risk, credit risk, utilization of derivative instruments and financial instruments that are not derivatives, and the investment of surplus liquidity.

### Market risk
Market risk encompasses currency risk, interest-rate risk and price risk. The Group's exposure to and management of currency risk and interest-rate risk are described below. The Group's exposure to price risk is limited and is not described in particular.

### Currency risk
Because of its international operations, the Group is exposed to currency risks in the form of transaction exposure and translation exposure. Transaction exposure arises as a result of future business transactions and translation exposure emerges as a result of recognized assets and liabilities in foreign currency as well as net investments in foreign operations. The Group's currency risk mainly arises from currency exposures in US dollars (USD), Euro (EUR), British Pounds (GBP), Japanese Yen (JPY) and Chinese Yuan (CNY).

The Group's net revenue arises primarily in USD, EUR and JPY, while the Group's net expenses largely arise in GBP, EUR and USD. Sales companies primarily have income and expenses in their functional currency while production companies are to a greater extent exposed to currency risk as sales are largely in a currency other than the functional currency. The currency risk that arises from future business transactions and recognized assets and

liabilities are managed using derivative contracts based on forecasted net flows and recognized net balances. Elekta's policy is to hedge the exchange-rate risk using forwards, the extent of which is determined by the Group's estimation of the exchange-rate risk and in accordance with the Group's established policy. Highly forecasted transaction exposure hedging is on the basis of expected net sales and hedging is conducted over a period up to 24 months. Each Group company is responsible for quantifying its transaction exposure in particular flow forecasts that then provide the basis for determination of the exposure and decisions on hedging measures. Currency hedging of recognized assets and liabilities in foreign currency is hedged, in accordance with policy, from 50 percent to 100 percent.

Hedging is carried out in order to reduce the effects of short-term fluctuations in currency markets. The Parent Company's direct and indirect holdings in foreign operations entail that net assets in the foreign operations are exposed to currency risk. Such net investments in foreign currency are hedged when viewed as appropriate on an individual basis, currently there are no outstanding net investment hedges.

Based on the year's income, expense, and currency structure (transaction exposure) a general change of one percentage point in the SEK exchange rate against other currencies would affect Group net profit and shareholders' equity by approximately – SEK 29 M (17), exclusive of hedging effects.

The table below shows the impact on operating income from a 1 percent weakening of the Swedish krona (SEK) in relation to the major currencies.

**Impact on operating income of a 1 percent weakening of SEK, SEK M**

**Interest-rate risk**

Interest-rate risk refers to the risk that changes in the interest rate level negatively affect Elekta's earnings.

Elekta's policy is to reduce the interest-rate risk through the use of loans, investments and derivatives. Hedging is carried out in order to reduce impact on result from interest rate movements and is never to exceed the amount and maturity of the underlying exposure. The Group's finance department analyzes exposure to interest-rate risk, whereby refinancing, turnover of existing positions, alternative financing and hedging are taken into account. Based on this, the effect on earnings that a certain change in the interest rate would have is calculated, in which the total change in the interest rate is used for all currencies. Elekta usually obtains long-term loans at a variable or fixed interest rate based on current market conditions. Conversion to fixed or variable interest rates is done using interest rate derivatives when this is deemed appropriate from a risk management and market perspective. An interest rate swap entails that the Group reaches agreement with another party with the indicated intervals (such as per quarter) to swap the difference between fixed and variable interest amount, estimated on the basis of the contracted nominal amount.

Based on the balance sheet structure at year-end and under the assumption that all other variables were constant, a general change in the interest rate on loans and investments by one percentage point would affect the Group's net result and shareholders' equity by –32 M (–20), excluding hedging effects. The impact on the result is mainly attributable to lower/higher interest expense for loans at variable interest rate.

On April 30, 2024, interest-bearing liabilities amounted to SEK 7,248 M (6,668), of which SEK 1,319 M (948) pertained to lease liabilities. The average fixed interest term was 0.9 years (1.1) and the weighted average interest rate, taking interest rate derivatives into account, was 4.65 percent (4.2). See Note 29 for more information on interest-bearing loans.

**Credit risk**

Credit risk arises via financial credit risk related to cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, derivative instruments and balances at banks and financial institutions as well as through credit exposure vis-à-vis customers and distributors. Credit risk is managed primarily at Group level, but, as regards credit risk in accounts receivable and accrued income, the primary responsibility lies with the individual Group companies. Maximum credit risk is deemed to correspond to the carrying values of the financial assets recognized in the balance sheet.

**Financial credit risk**

Elekta's finance policy includes special counterparty regulations in which the maximum credit exposure and the lowest credit rating for various counterparts are specified. Elekta's liquidity is invested in accordance with the determined policy, with the goal of maintaining high liquidity combined with a low credit risk.

Most of the subsidiary financing goes through internal loans from the Parent Company, therefore there is a credit risk originating from these. The opening balance of expected credit losses in the Parent Company amounted to SEK 21 M and the closing balance of expected credit loss reservation at the end of financial year 2023/24 was SEK 17 M.

**Credit risk in accounts receivable**

Credit risk in accounts receivable, including accrued income, are managed primarily by the individual group companies. The credit risk for each new customer is analyzed before the conditions for

payment and delivery are offered. A continuous follow up of the credit risk in receivables outstanding and agreed transactions are performed. A risk assessment is conducted continuously of credit worthiness through the observance of the customer's financial position and other influencing factors as well as previous experience. No single customer accounts for 10 percent or more of Elekta's net sales.

A continuous assessment is made of the credit risk in receivables outstanding and at the end of the financial year 2023/24 the provision for bad debts amounted to SEK 84 M. See ▶ **Note 25** for an analysis of credit exposure in accounts receivable and provision for bad debts.

**Liquidity risk**  
Liquidity risk pertains to the risk of not being able to cover payment obligations due to insufficient cash and cash equivalents or difficulties in obtaining external financing. The operating Group companies draw up cash flow forecasts, which are consolidated centrally. At the Group level, rolling forecasts for the Group's liquidity reserve are observed in order to ensure that the Group has sufficient cash resources to meet the requirements of current operations, while also retaining sufficient scope of unutilized credit facilities.

Excess liquidity in operating Group companies is usually transferred centrally and is managed by the Group's financial function. Investments are made primarily in interest-bearing accounts, term-limited borrowing, money market instruments, money market funds and tradable securities, depending on which instrument is viewed as having an appropriate term or sufficient liquidity to meet the particular situation. To reduce the liquidity risk, the Group endeavors to maintain readily available funds equal to at least 10 percent of net sales. On April 30, 2024, available cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments amounted to SEK 2,771 M (3,271), or 15 percent (19) of net sales. In addition, the Group had SEK 2,930 M (2,270) in unutilized credit facilities.

The table to the right shows the Group's liquidity risk through a maturity analysis regarding financial liabilities (including interest payments as applicable) and derivatives recognized as financial liabilities. The amounts noted in the table are contractual, undiscounted cash flows classified on the basis of the term on the balance sheet date that remains to the agreed maturity date.

**The Groups capital management**  
The primary objective of the Group's capital management is to secure a going concern through maintaining a high creditworthiness and a well-balanced capital structure with the aim of generating return to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, and to keep down the costs of capital.

## Note 4  Financial instruments

### Accounting principles 
A financial asset or a financial liability is reported in the balance sheet when the Group becomes party to the contractual terms and conditions of the financial instrument. A financial asset is derecognized from the balance sheet when the contractual rights are realized, fall due, or if the Company transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. Spot acquisitions or sales of financial assets are reported on the settlement date, which is the date on which the asset is delivered.

Financial assets are initially recognized at fair value plus transaction costs, except for those financial assets carried at fair value through the net income. Related transaction costs are expensed in the income statement.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and reported at a net amount in the balance sheet when there is a legal right to net and when the intention is to settle the items using a net amount or simultaneously realize the assets and settle the liability.

Subsequent measurement of financial assets, after the initial recognition at fair value, is based on what business model the Group have for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. For debt instruments there are three measurement categories with the following characteristics:
• Amortized cost; assets held with the intention for collection of contractual cashflows and the cashflow represent solely payments of principal and interest
• Fair value through other comprehensive income; assets held with the intention for collection of contractual cashflow and for selling it, and the cashflow represent solely payments of principal and interest
• Fair value through the profit or loss; all financial assets that do not meet the criteria for amortized cost or fair value through other comprehensive income

Equity instruments which are instrument that evidence a residual interest in the asset of an entity after deduction of all its liabilities, are measured at fair value through the net income.

The financial liabilities are classified into following measurement categories:
• fair value through profit or loss; liabilities held for trading
• amortized cost; liabilities not held for trading

### Financial assets measured at amortized cost
Assets are classified in this category when the intention is to hold the asset for collection of contractual cashflows and the cashflow represent solely payments of principal and interest.

In this category assets are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less any provision for impairment. Interest income and gains and losses are recognized in the income statement. The category includes accounts receivables as well as cash and bank.

#### Accounts receivable
Accounting principles for accounts receivables are disclosed in Note 25 Accounts receivables.

#### Cash and cash equivalent
Cash and cash equivalent comprise cash and bank balances with financial institutions and short-term investments with an original maturity of less than three months. Cash and bank are reported at amortized cost, while the short-term investments in money market funds are measured at fair value through the net income.

### Financial assets measured at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL)
All financial assets that do not meet the criteria for amortized cost or FVTOCI are measured as FVTPL. Assets are classified to this category when the intention is to sell in short term. Derivatives with a positive market value are classified in this category unless they are used for hedge accounting. Financial derivatives and short-term investments in tradeable securities as well as money market funds is classified in this category. Assets in this category are recognized at fair value and changes in value are recognized in the income statement.

### Impairment
Financial assets carried at amortized cost and FVTOCI are assessed for impairment based on expected credit losses. The expected credit loss allowance is based on historical credit loss experience, current conditions, and forward-looking economic conditions.

The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. For account receivables the Group applies the simplified approach to estimate the expected credit losses and uses a matrix based on country and ageing group.

### Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
This category includes derivatives with negative fair values that are not used for hedge accounting, financial liabilities held for trading and contingent considerations. Liabilities in this category are measured at fair value with changes in that value recognized in the income statement.

### Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost
This category includes financial liabilities that are not held for trading, for example loans and accounts payable. These are recognized initially at fair value, net after transaction costs, and subsequently at amortized cost according to the effective interest method.

#### Loan liabilities
Loan liabilities are initially reported at fair value, net of transaction costs, and subsequently at amortized cost according to the effective interest method.

#### Accounts payable
The valuation principle for accounts payable is the amortized cost principle. The expected lifetime for accounts payable is short and thus the payables are reported at nominal value without discounting.

### Accounting for derivatives used for hedging purposes
Elekta applies the hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9. All derivatives are initially and continuously recognized at fair value in the Balance sheet. Gains and losses on remeasurement of derivatives used for hedging purposes are recognized as follows. Changes in value relating to cash flow hedges are reported in other comprehensive income and are taken to the income statement as the hedged cash flow affects the income statement. Any ineffective portion of the change in value is reported directly in the income statement.

The result of a revaluation of derivatives used to hedge fair value is reported in the income statement along with changes in the fair value of the receivable or liability exposed to the hedged risk. For derivatives designated and qualified as hedging instruments

# Note 4 Financial instruments, cont.

ments, the method of recognizing the fair value gains or losses depends on the nature of the item being hedged.

The Company documents, at the inception of the hedge, the relationship between hedged item and financial derivative instrument, as well as its risk management objective and strategy. Also, the Company documents its assessment, both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items based on the following hedging criteria:
• There is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument
• The effect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from that economic relationship and
• The hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is consistent with risk management strategy

The table to the right presents Elekta's financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category with the carrying amount and fair value per item. Fair value for interest-bearing liabilities has been established by discounting future payment flows at current market interest rate and then converting to SEK at the current exchange rate. For other financial instruments the fair value is estimated to agree with the carrying amount.

The table above shows how Elekta's financial assets and financial liabilities, which are carried at fair value, have been categorized in the fair value hierarchy. The different levels are defined as follows. Level 1: Quoted prices on an active market for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Other observable data than quoted prices included in Level 1, either directly (that is, price quotations) or indirectly (that is, obtained from price quotations). Level 3: Data not based on observable market data.

**Financial instruments, level 1**  
The fair value of tradeable securities is reported based on quoted prices on an active market.

**Financial instruments, level 2**  
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded on an active market is determined by means of available valuation techniques. Market information is used when available. The use of corporate-specific information is avoided whenever possible. If all important input data required for a fair value valuation of an instrument is observable, the instrument is in level 2. Specific valuation techniques used in the valuation of financial instruments include, for example, listed market prices, fair value for interest-rate swaps, calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows based on observable yield, fair value of currency forward contracts determined through the use of rates for currency foreign exchange contracts on the balance sheet date.

**Financial instruments, level 3**  
The change during the year for instruments at level 3 refers to contingent considerations, valued at fair value. Input to the valuation is outcome, and estimates of the outcome relating to conditions set forth in the purchase agreement, usually revenue from the acquired business. Amounts expected to be paid in the future are discounted at a rate relevant for the respective business and market.

Note 4 Financial instruments, cont.

## Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities
Financial assets and financial liabilities set off only consist of derivative financial instruments.

| SEK M | Gross amount | Amounts set off in the balance sheet | Net amounts in the balance sheet | Amounts covered by netting ­agreements but not set off | Net amount | Gross amount | Amounts set off in the balance sheet | Net amounts in the balance sheet | Amounts covered by netting ­agreements but not set off | Net amount |
|-------|-------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------|-------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------|
| | | | 2023/24 | | | | | 2022/23 | | |
| Financial assets | 190 | – | 190 | −7 | 183 | 151 | – | 151 | −7 | 144 |
| Financial liabilities | 131 | – | 131 | −9 | 122 | 203 | – | 203 | −9 | 194 |

In the case of financial assets and liabilities that are subject to legally binding offsetting agreements, each agreement ­between the company and the counterparties permits net deduction of the relevant financial assets and liabilities if both parties elect to apply net deduction. If both parties are not in agreement regarding net deduction, gross deduction is applied. In the event that one party defaults, the other party is entitled to deduct on a net basis.

## Note 5 Estimates and assessments

The preparation of financial statements and application of accounting standards require that management use estimates and assessments. Therefore, they make certain assumptions which are considered reasonable under the prevailing circumstances. Thus, estimates and assessments affect the financial reports, and they are frequently based on experience as well as other factors, including expectations of future events. Using other assumptions than those applied in the preparation of the financial statements, the result can be different, and the actual outcome seldom complies with the anticipated result.

The most significant estimates and assessments at Elekta relate to:
• revenue recognition, see Note 7
• impairment testing of goodwill, see Note 18

Other areas subject to estimates and assessments are:
• valuation of accounts receivable, see Note 25
• calculation of deferred taxes, see Note 16
• capitalization and amortization of intangible assets, see Note 18
• calculation of provisions, see Note 30
• valuation of leases, see Note 19

Estimates and assessments are continually reassessed.

## Note 6 Segment reporting

### Accounting principles
Operating segments are reported in accordance with management reporting as reported to the chief operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker is the function that is responsible for allocation of resources and assessment of the operating segments' performance. In Elekta, this function has been identified as the President and CEO who is responsible for and deals with the continuous administration of the Group based on the board's guidelines and instructions. To his aid, he has the Executive Committee. Elekta's President and CEO evaluates business performance from both geographic and product based perspective. The geographic follow-up is however the main perspective and the product based perspective constitutes a complement to the geographic monitoring and control. It is from the geographic perspective that the business activity is conducted and managed. Evaluation of financial performance is executed for three geographic regions which are Elekta's operating segments:
• Americas
• EMEA
• APAC

The same accounting principles are applied in the segment reporting as for the Group.

See Note 18 for information on goodwill per region. For information regarding tangible assets per country see Note 20.

## Note 7 Net sales

Elekta's revenue is primarily derived from the sales of treatment solutions and oncology software including equipment used for radiation therapy, radiosurgery and brachytherapy as well as software products and related services.

Many of Elekta's products and services are sold on a stand-alone basis but are often included in bundled deals, which are arrangements where equipment, software and services may be included in the same contract. A bundled deal is treated as a project which is supported by a project team that coordinates the production, delivery and installation, which can occur at different stages. The equipment, installation, software and services are distinct performance obligations excluding the software that is integrated in the hardware.

In most contracts the transaction price consists of a fixed consideration which is clearly stated in the contract and the products are usually sold without a right of return. In rare cases contracts can include variable consideration for which the value is estimated for revenue recognition purposes.

### Accounting principles
The allocation of the transaction price, including any discount, to the various goods and services (performance obligations) in a contract is performed based on the relative stand-alone selling prices for the goods and services identified as performance obligations. As many items included in a bundled deal are also sold on a stand-alone basis, the stand-alone selling prices are based on observable prices in most cases. For items not sold on a stand-alone basis the stand-alone selling prices have been estimated using the best available market and internal data relating to those items.

Costs incurred to obtain a contract consist mainly of commissions, which is recognized as contract asset and are amortized over the time when the related revenue is recognized.

The timing for revenue recognition of products and services included in a bundled deal depend on its nature and when control for each product or service has been transferred to the customer. Payment terms or conditions for projects differ between regions. In some markets, partial payments will be due upon certain events such as order receipt, delivery and acceptance. In other markets, the entire payment is due upon completion of implementation or acceptance. Amounts invoiced are reported as accounts receivable while revenue recognized amounts not yet invoiced are reported as accrued income.

**Note 7 Net sales, cont.**

## Treatment solutions
Elekta sells treatment solutions including hardware, software and service. Main hardware products are Leksell Gamma Knife, Linear accelerators, MR-Linacs and Afterloaders. Software licenses consist mainly of Oncology informatics systems (OIS) and Treatment planning systems (TPS). Services include maintenance and support relating to equipment, software, training, installation services and warranties. Most bundled deals include at least one device, software licenses, installation, service, training and one-year standard warranty that is included in the price. There is a possibility for an extended warranty in some contracts that is considered as a service contract. Revenue recognition for these deals is linked to when control for each identified performance obligation is transferred to the customer, which for a standard contract happens at different stages over a longer period, usually up to six months depending on the geographical market.

## Hardware products
In a standard contract, control is considered to be transferred when the device is delivered to the customer's site and installation is started. At this time, the customer has physical possesion of the unit and Elekta has the right to payment for the equipment delivered.

## Software products
For software licenses control is considered to be transferred and revenue is recognized when the licenses are made available to the customer, which is usually at the time of acceptance of the software.

## Service contracts
For service agreements, control is considered to be transferred over time and revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual term of the arrangement or the expected period during which the specified services will be performed. Maintenance and support agreements relating to software products are generally renewed on an annual basis. Installation services and training with low values and which span over a limited time are considered non-material and revenue is recognized when the related device reaches the stage of technical acceptance.

## Estimates and assessment
Changes to the goods and services included in an arrangement and the amounts allocated to each item could affect the timing and amount of revenue recognition. Revenue recognition also depends on the timing of shipment, readiness of the customer's site, availability of products and for some contracts, customer acceptance terms. If shipments or installations are not made on scheduled timelines or if the products are not accepted by the customer in a timely manner, revenues may differ from expectations.

Revenue recognition does often not coincide with invoicing to, and payments from, customers. Payment terms or conditions for projects may differ between contracts and regions, but in a standard Elekta contract partial payments will be due upon certain events, such as order receipt, shipment and acceptance. In a standard project, amounts invoiced in accordance with an invoicing plan are reported as accounts receivable and as a contract liability included in advances from customers if performance obligations are not yet satisfied and revenue cannot be recognized. Amounts that have been recognized as revenue, but for which Elekta has not yet the right to invoice according to the invoicing plan agreed, are reported as contract assets and included in accrued income. For service contracts the agreed consideration is invoiced and paid in advance in most markets. When there is a contract agreed and invoiced to the customer, Elekta usually has the right to payment even if the performance obligations are still to be satisfied. Therefore, a receivable is accounted for with a corresponding contract liability reported as deferred income.

Net sales for the year amounted to SEK 18,119 M (16,869). Accrued income amounted to SEK 2,050 M (2,119). Accounts receivable amounted to SEK 3,877 M (3,990). For more information on accounts receivable see **Note 24**.

Net sales per country is based on sales to customers in the respective country. There is no individual customers representing more than 10 percent of net sales.

## Note 8  Personnel costs

### Accounting principles
Personnel costs comprise of fixed wages and salaries, variable remuneration, pension, and other benefits. Personnel costs are recognized when incurred. Accounting principles related to pensions are reported in ► Note 30. 

### Share-based compensation
Ongoing share programs are reported according to IFRS 2 Share-based payments and are mainly equity-settled. The conditions of the share programs state that they may be settled in other ways than through shares. This possibility is only applied to a very limited extent and neither cost nor obligation are material amounts. 

Accounting for equity-settled share-based compensation programs entails that the instrument's fair value at grant date is recognized in the income statement over the vesting period, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. This leads to an estimated cost, corresponding to the earned portion of the estimated share value at allotment, being charged to profit and loss over the vesting period. Market-based share are not revalued during the remainder of the vesting period after the fair value is established, except if the condition of continued employment during the vesting period is no longer fulfilled. 

In addition, provisions are made for estimated employer contributions related to the share programs. Calculations are based on a theoretical market valuation where the market value is calculated using Monte Carlo simulation based on the share price on the closing date. For allotted shares, social security expenses are paid based on the market value on the allotment date.

### Salaries, other remuneration and social security costs

| SEK thousands | Fixed remuneration | Variable remuneration | Share-based compensation | Other benefits | Pension costs | Total |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| President and CEO | 7,403 | 4,995 | 3,727 | 94 | 2,129 | 18,348 |

| Total senior executives | 54,691 | 22,963 | 18,320 | 3,486 | 9,334 | 108,794 |

Variable remuneration pertains to the bonus for the 2023/24 and 2022/23 fiscal years respectively, partly paid quarterly during each fiscal year and partly paid in the year after.

## Share based compensation
As per April 30, 2024, Elekta has three outstanding share programs. The program performance share plan LTI 2020/23, which was outstanding as per April 30, 2023, has expired during the year.

The total number of shares that may be allotted under the share programs is 1,764,886 (1,144,160) B-shares. The share programs are secured by delivery of shares already held or repurchased by Elekta and, consequently, no new shares will be issued under the share programs. Share programs awarded to employees have a potential dilution effect.

The recognized costs related to the share programs amounted to SEK 19 M (20) and social security amounted to SEK 3 M (5). For more information see page 28.

The long-term incentive (LTI) programs called Performance share plans are approved by the AGM. Performance share plan LTI 2020/23, resolved by the AGM in 2019, expired during the year. Outstanding share programs as per April 30 2023 were performance share plan, LTI 2021/24, LTI 2022/25 and LTI 2023/26. The performance share plans cover 25 (LTI 2021/24), 19 (LTI 2022/25) and 22 (LTI 2023/26) key employees of the Group respectively. The performance share plans entitle the participants to obtain, free of charge, B-shares in Elekta upon fulfillment of certain performance requirements.

The main terms of the performance share programs are:
• A performance share award shall entitle a participant to receive, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the performance share plans and applicable award agreements, a number of B-shares based upon the attainment of performance targets over a three-year performance period
• Each performance share award shall be subject to forfeiture in the event of termination of employment due to a reason other than death, disability or retirement or failure to attain performance targets over the applicable performance period.
• Performance share awards shall be settled through the delivery of shares unless otherwise decided by the board
• The number of shares to be allotted will depend on the degree of fulfillment of financial and ESG targets

The financial targets for performance share plans are defined as Total Shareholder Return (TSR) relative to the OMXS30 index over a three-year period. The minimum performance requirement is that Elekta TSR outperform the OMXS30 index with at least +0.1 percent. The maximum performance level requires that Elekta TSR outperform the OMXS30 Index at or above +15 percent. If the minimum performance level is reached, the allocation will amount up to (and will not exceed) 25 percent of annual base salary at the beginning of the fiscal year 2020/21 for performance share plan LTI 2021/23, at the beginning of fiscal year 2021/22 for performance plan LTI 2021/24 and at the beginning of fiscal year 2022/23 for performance plan LTI 2022/25 and at the beginning of fiscal year 2023/24 for the performance plan LTI 2023/26. The actual minimum value for each participant will be subject to an individual performance evaluation for the past fiscal year. If the maximum performance level is reached or exceeded, the allocation will amount to (and will not exceed) the maximum number of performance shares. If performance is below the maximum level but above the minimum level, a proportionate allocation of shares will be made. No allocation will be made if performance is below the minimum level.

The performance share plan of 2023/26 will in addition to the TSR relative to OMX30 also include two ESG targets; Access to Healthcare, i.e number of installed linacs in underserved markets, as well as CO2 equivalents reductions from operations over a three-year period. The weighting between the three targets is as follows; Relative TSR with a weighting of 85%, access to

Healthcare and CO₂ equivalents reduction with a weighting of 7.5% each. Regarding the ESG targets, the minimum performance requirement is that Elekta installs 502 linacs in underserved markets and reduces its' CO₂ emissions from operations by 0.1 per cent during the three-year performance period. The maximum performance level requires Elekta to install 652 linacs in underserved markets and reduces its' CO₂ emissions from operations by 13.86 per cent during the three-year performance period.

The terms of the performance share plan further state that:
• The performance targets may be adjusted should an event occur that affects the operations of the Company or the number of outstanding Elekta shares or otherwise affecting the performance targets and deemed relevant by the board.
• The performance targets will be finally evaluated at the end of the applicable performance period and each participant will receive the number of shares he/she is entitled to according to the participant's award agreement depending on the attainment of the applicable performance targets over the performance period
• The value that a participant can receive in settlement of the performance share award is maximized at 400 percent of the value of the shares at the date of grant of the performance share award

• Potential allotments of shares will take place September 16, 2024 (LTI 2021/24), September 16, 2025 (LTI 2022/25), and September 16, 2026 (LTI 2023/26) respectively.

Participants shall at allotment of shares receive compensation for any cash dividends paid during the respective three-year performance period. The participants shall at allotment of shares of series B not receive any cash compensation for any cash dividend under the Performance Period September 2023 to September 2026.

Before the number of shares to be allotted is finally determined, the board shall examine whether the allotment is reasonable, taking into consideration the Company's financial results and position, conditions on the stock market and other circumstances, and if not, as determined by the board, reduce the number of shares to be allotted to the lower number of shares deemed appropriate by the board. Delivery of shares and dividend compensation in settlement of the performance share award shall be made as soon as practicable following the lapse of the performance period.

The conditions of the share programs state that the right to performance share awards may be settled in other ways than through the delivery of shares. As per April 30, 2024, there were no material obligations to settle in any other way than through shares.

# FINANCIAL NOTES

Annual Report 2023/24                 54

## Note 16  Taxes

### Accounting principles
The tax expense in the income statement includes all income tax that is to be paid or received for the current year, adjustments relating to previous years' current tax, and changes in deferred tax. Deferred tax is calculated on the basis of the temporary differences between the tax bases and the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets relating to loss carry-forwards and other future tax credits are recognized to the extent it is probable that deductions can be made against future profits. Valuation is based on nominal amounts based on the tax rules prevailing in each country and the anticipated tax rate for the following year in each country. Deferred taxes relating to temporary differences attributable to investments in subsidiaries are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements since Elekta AB, in all cases, can control the time of reversal of the temporary differences and it is not considered probable that such a reversal will occur in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset tax assets against tax liabilities and when the deferred tax amounts refer to the same tax authority. For items recognized in the net income, the related tax effects are also recognized in the net income.

Elekta is within the scope of the OECD Pillar Two model rules, an international tax reform which aims to ensure that large multinational groups pay a minimum tax on income arising in each jurisdiction in which they operate. Thus, Elekta becomes liable to pay top-up taxes on profits in each jurisdiction where the effective tax rate calculated according to the GloBE rules is below the minimum tax rate of 15%. The Pillar Two legislation has been enacted in Sweden and applies from January 1, 2024. Elekta applies the exception to recognizing and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes, provided in the amendments to IAS 12. Potential exposure arising from the new legislation is not expected to have any material impact on the results in any of the main jurisdictions in which Elekta currently operates.

The Group is continuing to assess the impact of Pillar Two income taxes legislation on its future financial performance, however, based on the analysis performed it is not expected that the legislation effective in 2024 will have a material impact on the results, cash flows or financial position.

### Estimates and assessments
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are balance sheet items which are subject to estimates and assessments. Deferred tax is calculated on temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax values of assets and liabilities. Estimates and assessments affect the recognized deferred tax amounts in the determination of the carrying amounts of the different assets and liabilities, and also through forecasts regarding future taxable profits in those cases where a future utilization of deferred tax assets depends on future taxable profits.

### Income taxes
Deferred taxes amounted to a net receivable of SEK 385 M (230), whereof assets SEK 801 M (703) and liabilities SEK 416 M (473).

# FINANCIAL NOTES

Annual Report 2023/24    56

## Note 18 Intangible assets

### Accounting principles
Intangible assets contain goodwill, capitalized development costs, customer contracts, customer relationships, technology, patents, and licenses. Amortization of intangible assets is reported in the income statement and allocated to functions as applicable.

### Goodwill
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators are identified.

### Research and development
Research costs are expensed as they are incurred. In those instances, in which it is difficult to distinguish between the research phase and the development phase in a project, the entire project is considered as research and is expensed as incurred. Identifiable costs for the development of new products are capitalized to the extent that these are considered to provide future economic benefits. In other instances, development expenditures are expensed as they are incurred. Costs for development once reported in the income statement are never capitalized in future periods. Capitalized expenditures are amortized on a straight-line basis from the time when the asset is available for use, which normally occurs when it is produced commercially, and during the estimated useful life of the asset.

### Customer relations and other intangible assets
Intangible assets also include customer relationships, customer contracts and technology acquired through business combinations, patents, and licenses. These assets are recognized when acquired at the amount of their purchase cost including any directly attributable cost and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life.

### Amortization periods:

| | |
|---|---|
| Capitalized development cost | 3–5 years |
| Technology | 5–20 years |
| Customer relationships and contracts | 5–20 years |
| Patents | 3–10 years |

### Impairment
The carrying amount of an intangible asset is tested for impairment whenever there are indications that the carrying amount might not be recoverable. If there are indications of impairment, the asset's recoverable amount is calculated. The recoverable amount is the higher of the value in use of the asset and the value that would be received if the asset was sold to a third party less selling costs. Value in use consists of all incoming and outgoing payments attributable to the asset during the period it is expected to be used in operations, plus the net realizable value at the end of the useful life. If the calculated recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, impairment is made to the asset's recoverable amount. An impairment loss recognized in previous periods is reversed if the reasons for the impairment no longer exist. However, a reversal will not be higher than the carrying amount would have been if an impairment loss had not been recognized in previous periods.

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, and when there are indicators which suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The impairment test is performed at the level of cash-generating units (CGUs) which represent the Group's operating segments. For the impairment test, the carrying amount of the goodwill is allocated to the CGUs and is compared to their recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the CGU fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. All impairment losses, and any reversals of the same, are recognized in the income statement.

### Estimates and assessment
For the Group, the most significant estimates and assumptions are those relating to impairment testing of goodwill. This means that the effect on the financial reports may be considerable if the estimates and assessments made would prove to deviate significantly from the actual outcome. In connection with impairment testing of goodwill the carrying amount is compared with the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is determined by the higher of an asset's net realizable value and its value in use. Normally, it is not possible to determine the net realizable value. Therefore, the value in use is normally the value being compared with the carrying amount. Thus, each cash generating unit's value in use is calculated in assessing any impairment of goodwill. Calculations are performed through discounting future estimated cash flows. In order to perform the calculations a number of assumptions concerning future circumstances and estimates of parameters are made. Any adjustments of the assumptions made could have an effect on the carrying amount of the goodwill. Assuming a lower growth rate would lead to a lower recoverable amount. A higher discount rate would also lead to a lower recoverable amount.

Capitalized development costs comprise capitalized expenditure for research and development as well as other capitalized development costs such as software. Total capitalized development costs amounted to SEK 1,343 M (1,345) for the year whereof capitalization of development costs within R&D represented SEK 1,331 M (1,338).

### Goodwill
The allocation of the carrying amount of goodwill to CGUs is shown in the following table.

#### Goodwill by segment

| SEK M | 30/04/2024 | 30/04/2023 |
|-------|------------|------------|
| North and South America | 2,697 | 2,184 |
| Europe, Middle East and Africa | 2,727 | 2,394 |
| Asia Pacific | 2,065 | 2,359 |

The discount rates correspond to the GCUs current weighted cost of capital and are based on current market assessments.

The group performed its annual impairment test using data as of January 2024. The 2024 (2023) test showed that there is no need for impairment.

Sensitivity analysis have been carried out based on an increase of the discount rates by 2 percentage points and reduction of the long-term growth of 1 percentage point. The sensitivity analyses did not lead to any impairment indicators.

The value in use for each unit is derived from discounted cash flows, based on estimated future cash flows. The estimates are based on the financial budget for the next fiscal year as determined by the Executive Committee, and expected future development up to five years. Assumptions regarding sales volume, sales prices, operating expenses and product mix form the basis for estimated future growth and margin development.

Volume assumptions are based on historical outcome, the Executive Committee's expectations on market development, and expected global market growth. Price assumptions are based on current market trends and inflation forecasts. Margin development is based on current margin levels and product mix adjusted for expected price changes and possible changes in the product mix. For periods after five years, the extrapolation of

## Note 19 Leases

### Accounting principles
Elekta's lease contracts mainly consist of contracts for premises, vehicles and equipment. For premises and equipment, theGroup accounts for the lease and non-lease components of a contract separately. Leases are recognized as a liability and a corresponding right-of-use asset at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Group.

The lease payments are discounted using the Group's incremental borrowing rate. To determine the incremental borrowing rate the Group uses a risk-free interest rate and adjusts for credit risk as well as specific adjustments for different durations and currencies.

As of April 30, 2024 the balance sheet shows the following amounts related to leases:

### Right-of-use assets

¹⁾ Additions includes new lease contracts, index-adjustments and remeasurements.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term. If the group is reasonably certain to exercise a purchase option, the right-of-use asset is depreciated over the underlying asset's useful life.

The Group's lease contracts for premises typically range between fixed periods of 1 to 20 years, the vehicle leases usually have a lease term of 3–5 years, and equipment leases usually have a lease term of 3–5 years. Elekta has a number of contracts where the contractual terms include extension and termination options that are included when it is determined as reasonably certain that they will be exercised. The assessment of reasonable certainty is only revised if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs. The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases and the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of assets that are considered to be of low value.

Payments associated with short-term leases and low-value assets are recognized as expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of less than 12 months. The Group does not apply IFRS 16 to intangible assets.

### Amounts recognized in the income statement

| SEK M | 2023/24 | 2022/23 |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Depreciation for the year | 261 | 242 |
| Interest expense (included in finance cost) | 48 | 38 |
| Expense relating to short-term leases (included in cost of goods sold and administrative expenses) | 2 | 1 |
| Expense relating to leases of low-value assets that are not shown above as short-term leases (included in administrative expenses) | 1 | 2 |
| **Total** | **312** | **282** |

No material variable lease payments not included in the lease liability has been identified. Low-value assets comprise small items such as printers and coffee machines.

Total cash outflow for leases during fiscal year 2023/24 was SEK 338 M (291).

Leasing fees paid by the Parent Company during the year amounted to SEK 324 K (304). Future leasing fees due for payment within one year amount to SEK 292 K, after 1 year but within 5 years to SEK 85 K.

Tangible assets in acquired companies are recognized at fair value on the acquisition date. Buildings are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 50 years. Machinery and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis during its economic life of between 3 and 10 years. The residual value of assets and their useful economic lives are reviewed annually and adjusted prospectively, if required.

## Note 24  Inventories

### Accounting principles
Inventories are valued in accordance with the 'first in, first out' 
principle at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost is 
based on a standard cost method. Net realizable value is calculated as the selling price less costs attributable to the sale. Internal profits arising from deliveries between Group companies are 
eliminated upon consolidation.

### Inventories

| SEK M | Group |  |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
|  | April 30, 2024 | April 30, 2023 |
| Components | 430 | 379 |
| Work in progress | 111 | 84 |
| Finished goods | 2,717 | 2,607 |
| Total | 3,259 | 3,070 |

Write-down of inventories during the year amounted to SEK 44 M 
(103). In the income statement this is reported as cost of product 
sold. No material inventory is carried at net realisable value.

## Note 25  Accounts receivable and contract assets

### Accounting principles
Accounts receivable are initially recognized at their nominal value 
and subsequently measured at nominal value less provisions for 
expected credit losses. Due to the short-term nature of the 
accounts receivables, the Group expects that the effect of discounting of account receivable would be immaterial. Impairment loss on accounts receivable is recognized in operating 
income. Elekta applies the simplified approach for measuring 
expected credit losses for accounts receivable in accordance with 
IFRS 9. A general provision is calculated using a provision matrix 
comprising of provision rates by country and ageing group. The 
provision rates are based on historical loss experience, current 
market conditions and forward-looking economic conditions. 
Specific provisions are recorded for exposures to customers with 
high risk of default. Accounts receivable are written off when the 
probability of collection is deemed to be unlikely and no further 
collection efforts are made.

# FINANCIAL NOTES

Annual Report 2023/24                64

## Note 30 Provisions

### Accounting principles
Provisions are reported when the Group has an obligation resulting from a past event for which it is probable that payments will be required to settle the obligation and it is possible to make a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation.

### Pensions
Most of the Group's pension commitments are met through payments to authorities or other independent organizations that administer the pension plans. For these defined contribution pension plans, a pension cost is reported on a continuous basis as the benefits are earned, which normally coincides with the date on which the fees are paid.

The Group has defined benefit pension plans for certain employees in a few countries. Under these defined benefit plans, the Group has an obligation to provide agreed benefits to current and former employees. The related actuarial and investment risks fall on the Group. The obligation for defined benefit plans is remeasured at each balance sheet date using actuarial assumptions and the so-called projected unit credit method that distributes the costs over the employee's working life. These obligations are measured at the present value of the expected future payments.

### Restructuring provision
Restructuring provisions are recognized only when the Group has an obligation, which is when: (i) there is a detailed formal plan that identifies the business or part of the business concerned, the location and number of employees affected, the detailed estimate of the associated costs, and the timeline; and (ii) the employees affected have been notified of the plan's main features.

### Warranty provisions
Estimated costs for product guarantees are charged against operating costs in conjunction with the income recognition of the products. The estimated costs are established using historic statistics, with known changes taken into account regarding product quality, repair costs etc.

### Estimates and assessment
Provisions include uncertainties and entails various judgments. Provisions for guarantees are based on historic statistics, while others, such as provisions for legal disputes and restructuring are based on management's best estimate of the expected outcome. Provisions for defined benefit plans are based on actuarial valuations which rely on key assumptions including discount rate, future salary increase and inflation. Total provisions amounted to SEK 383 M (426).

## Key assumptions used in the valuation of the pension liability (weighted average)

| | Group | |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| | April 30, 2024 | April 30, 2023 |
| Discount rate used (%) | 3.2 | 3.5 |
| Future salary increase, % (weighted average) | 2.9 | 2.7 |
| Inflation, % | 2.9 | 2.4 |

## Sensitivity analysis of the most important assumptions affecting the recognized pension liability

| | Group | |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| | April 30, 2024 | April 30, 2023 |
| Discount rate +0.5% | −6.7 | −6.6 |
| Discount rate –0.5% | 9.4 | 9.1 |
| Salary increase rate +0.5% | 3.1 | 3.2 |
| Salary increase rate –0.5% | −1.5 | −1.5 |
| Inflation, +0,5% | 1.9 | 3.1 |
| Inflation, –0,5% | −2.2 | −1.4 |

The sensitivity analyses are based on estimated reasonable changes in a significant assumption, keeping all other assumptions constant. The sensitivity analyses may not be representative of an actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that changes in assumptions would occur in isolation from one another.

## Plan assets in %

| | Group | |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| SEK M | April 30, 2024 | April 30, 2023 |
| Assets held by insurance company | 95% | 95% |
| Other | 5% | 5% |
| | 100% | 100% |

## Discount rate

The discount rate reflects the estimated timing of benefit payments and is used for measuring the present value of the obligation. A fluctuation in the discount rate will have material effect on the pension obligation but will also impact the interest income and expense reported in the finance net. To determine the discount rate, Elekta considers AA-rated corporate bonds indexes consistent with the currencies of the plans and matching the duration of the pension obligations.
