## NOTE 1 ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND OTHER INFORMATION

### General

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and interpretations of the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) as endorsed by the EU at the date of publication of this annual report. The Group also applies the Swedish Financial Reporting Board recommendation RFR 1 Supplementary Accounting Rules for groups which specifies additional disclosures required under the Swedish Annual Accounts Act.

The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the basis of historical cost, with the exception of some financial instruments in form of other non-current holding of securities, contingent considerations and derivatives which are carried at fair value. A defined benefit pension liability/asset is recognized at the net fair value of plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit liability, adjusted for any asset constraints. Unless otherwise specified, all amounts are in millions of Swedish kronor (SEK) and are based on the twelve-month period January 1 to December 31 for items related to comprehensive income and cash flows, and as of December 31 for items related to financial position. Adjustments for rounding are not made.

### New and revised IFRS applied from January 1, 2023

There are no new or revised standards and interpretations adopted as of January 1, 2023 that have had a significant impact on the Tele2's financial statements.

### New and revised IFRS not yet adopted

There are no new or revised standards and interpretations that will have a significant impact on Tele2's financial statements in 2024. No newly issued IFRS or interpretations have been adopted in advance.

### Consolidation

#### Subsidiaries

The consolidated financial statements include the parent company Tele2 AB and companies in which the parent company has control. Control is achieved when Tele2 is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with an entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the acquisition method. This means that consolidated equity only includes the subsidiary's equity that has arisen after the acquisition and the consolidated income statements only include earnings from the date of acquisition until the date of divestment if the subsidiary is sold. The Group's acquisition value of the shares in subsidiaries, transferred consideration, consists of the total of the fair value at the time of the acquisition of what was paid in cash, incurred liabilities to former owners, fair value of emitted shares, the value of the non-controlling interests in the acquired subsidiary and the fair value of the previously owned shares. Contingent consideration is included in the transferred consideration and is reported at fair value at the time of the acquisition. Subsequent effects from the revaluation of contingent consideration are reported in the income statement. Acquired identifiable assets and assumed liabilities are generally reported initially at fair value at the time of the acquisition. Reported goodwill is measured as the difference between 1) the transferred consideration for the shares in the subsidiary, the value of the non-controlling interests in the acquired subsidiary and the fair value of the previously owned share compared to 2) the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities. Acquisition related expenses (transaction expenses) are recognised as cost in the period in which they arise.

When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, a gain or loss is calculated as the difference between:
• the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interests and
• the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities and any non-controlling interests.

Any gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. All amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to that subsidiary are, proportionally in relation to the divested share, reclassified to profit or loss.

### Joint arrangements

Joint arrangements are arrangements of which two or more parties have a joint control. Joint arrangements are classified either as joint operation or joint venture. Joint operations, usually structured through separate vehicles, are joint arrangements in which Tele2 and one or more parties have rights to substantially all of the economic benefits from the assets of the arrangement. In addition, the liabilities incurred by the arrangement are satisfied by the cash flows received from the parties through their purchases of the output or capital contributions. Joint operations are reported according to the proportional method at which Tele2 reports its part of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and its share of joint assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses line by line in the consolidated financial statements. Sales and other transactions with joint operations are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. For Tele2, joint operations consist of jointly owned companies, please refer to section Estimates and judgments.

Joint ventures are arrangements where Tele2 has right to the net assets of the other entity and are accounted for under the equity method.

At the acquisition of a share in a joint arrangement, a purchase price allocation is prepared at the acquisition date. The acquisition date is the date when the Group becomes a part to and jointly shares the control of the joint arrangement. The starting-point for the purchase price allocation consists of the acquisition value of the share in the joint arrangement. The acquisition value is allocated on the Group's

Note 1 cont.

share of the acquisition date fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities including related deferred taxes and any implied goodwill.

Associated companies
Associated companies are companies in which Tele2 has a voting power of between 20 percent and 50 percent or has significant influence in some other way.

Associated companies are accounted for in accordance with the equity method. This means that the Group's carrying amount of the shares in the company corresponds to the Group's share of equity after application of the Group's accounting principles as well as any residual value of consolidated surplus values. The share of the company's profit or loss after tax is reported under "Operating profit", along with depreciation of the Group surplus values.

Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent that corresponds to the Group's interest in the company. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no need for impairment.

Foreign currency
The accounts of all foreign group companies, joint arrangements and associated companies are prepared in the currency used in the primary economic environment of each company, i.e. the functional currency which for all group companies, joint arrangements and associated companies is the local currency.

The assets and liabilities of foreign group companies, joint arrangements and associated companies are translated into Tele2's reporting currency (SEK) at the closing exchange rates, while revenues and expenses are translated at the period's average exchange rates. Exchange rate differences arising from translation are reported in other comprehensive income. When foreign group companies, joint arrangements and associated companies are divested, the accumulated exchange rate difference attributable to the sold operation is recognised in the income statement.

Goodwill and adjustments at fair value that are made in connection with the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities in the functional currency of the acquired operation.

Discontinued operations
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group which either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and represents a separate line of business or geographical area of operation. A discontinued operation is reported separately from continuing operations in the income statement, and comparable information for prior periods is re-presented.

Assets classified as held for sale and associated liabilities are presented separately on the face of the balance sheet. Prior periods are not affected. Assets classified as held for sale are valued at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell (Note 33).

Revenue recognition
Revenues include sale of services to consumers, business to business (B2B), landlords and other operators of mobile and fixed telephony, broadband, and TV. This includes subscription and periodic charges, call charges, interconnect revenue from other operators, sale of equipment such as mobile phones and modems, connection and installation charges, data and information services and service revenues. Revenues are valued and recognised on the basis of the compensation specified in the contract with the customer, i.e. net of VAT, discounts and returns. Assessments or judgements on customer behaviour used in revenue recognition are continually revised as to secure a fair representation.

For subscription and periodic charges, Tele2 transfer the control of the service over time and the revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period. The fees are invoiced in advance or monthly after the service has been transferred to the customer, the payment term is typically up to 30 days. Periodic charges for basic television services to landlords are invoiced largely quarterly. When the fees are invoiced in advance and Tele2 has received the consideration or has an unconditional right to the consideration, Tele2 accounts for a contract liability which is recognised as revenue as the customer obtains the control of the service.

Call charges and interconnect revenue are recognised in the period during which the service is provided.

Revenue from the sale of prepaid cards and similar prepayments are recognised based on the actual use of the card up until the expiry date. The timing of revenue recognition related to the portion expected not to be utilised by the customer will be recognised as revenue in proportion to the customer's use pattern. The timing difference between the payment and the revenue recognised is accounted for as a contract liability.

Revenue from sale of equipment is recognised when control of the equipment has been transferred to the customer and the group has the right to payment. The payment is made through monthly instalments or at the time of delivery. When there is a significant difference in timing between the payment and the revenue recognised for the equipment, the group adjust the transaction prices allocated to the equipment, for the time value of money.

Connection and installation charges and other upfront fees are recognised at the time of the sale to the extent that Tele2 delivered goods or service according to the same principles as for customer contracts containing multiple performance obligations as described above.

Revenues from data and information services such as data buckets, text messages and third-party services are recognised when the service is provided.

Services to B2B customers, including functional based solutions for complete telecom and network services that may include switchboard services, fixed and mobile telephony, data communication and other customised services as well as system installations, are recognised over time using the percentage of completion method. The revenues are recognised gradually during the contract as the services are performed as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided. The stage

NOTES – GROUP

Note 1 cont.

of completion is determined by services performed to date as a percentage of total services to be performed, based on cost incurred in relation to estimated total cost.

For customer agreements containing multiple deliverables or parts, the contracted revenue is allocated to each part, based on its relative fair value. Services invoiced based on usage are not included in the allocation. Revenues for each part are recognised in the period when control of the goods or service is transferred to the customer. When re-allocating revenue between equipment and services is made it can result in revenue recognition taking place at different time (earlier or later) than the goods or service is paid for. The time difference between the payment and the revenue recognised for the performance obligation is recognised as a contract asset or contract liability, for further information refer to Note 16, 20 and 26.

When Tele2 acts as an agent for another supplier, such as handset sales through third party resellers and content services, the revenue is reported net, i.e. only the part of the revenue that is allocated to Tele2 is reported as revenue when control of the goods is transferred to the customer or in the period during which the service is provided.

Most goods or subscriptions are sold with a right of return. Right to return vary normally from 14 days up to 30 days. If the right to return is expected to be utilised the revenue is recognised when the right has expired. Right to return does not apply for Tele2 when the good or subscription is sold through a third party.

Contract modifications occur due to changes in the price plan or when adding value added services. A change in the price plan will result in a new recognised revenue going forward. The value added services are distinct and priced at fair value and recognised as a new contract.

## Operating expenses

Operating expenses are classified according to function, as described below. Depreciation and amortisation and personnel costs are stated by function. Total costs for depreciation and amortisation are presented in Note 5 and total personnel costs are presented in Note 31.

### Cost of services provided and equipment sold

Cost of services provided, and equipment sold consists of broadcaster costs, costs for networks and capacity, interconnect charges as well as costs for equipment sold (e.g. handsets) to the extent the costs are covered by recognised revenues. The cost of services provided, and equipment sold also includes the part of the cost for personnel, premises, purchased services and depreciation and amortisation of non-current assets, including right-of-use assets, attributable to the production of sold services.

### Selling expenses

Selling expenses include costs for the internal sales organisation, purchased services, personnel costs, cost for right-of-use assets, bad debt losses as well as depreciation and amortisation of non-current assets attributable to sales activities. Advertising and other marketing activities are also included and are expensed as incurred. Selling expenses also include the portion of Tele2's cost for handsets and other equipment for which Tele2 does not get full cost coverage.

### Administrative expenses

Administrative expenses consist of the part of the personnel costs, purchased services as well as depreciation and amortisation of non-current assets, including right-of-use assets, attributable to the other joint functions. Costs associated with the Board of Directors, executive management and corporate functions are included in administrative expenses.

### Other operating income and other operating expenses

Other operating income and other operating expenses include secondary activities, exchange rate differences in operating activities and gain/loss on the sale of tangible and intangible assets.

## Employee benefits

### Share-based payments

Tele2 grants share-based payments to certain employees. Share-based payments are settled with the company's own shares, so called equity-settled payments.

The costs for equity-settled payments are based on the fair value of the share rights calculated by an independent party at the date of grant. These payments are reported as employee costs during the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity. To the extent the vesting conditions in the program are linked to market conditions (TSR), these factors are taken into consideration when determining the fair value of the share rights and is not adjusted for performance. Non-market performance conditions (e.g. operating cashflow) and service conditions (employment period) are taken into account in employee cost during the vesting period by the change in the number of shares that are expected to finally vest.

Tele2 records a liability for social security expenses, at each reporting period, for all outstanding share-based payments. Social security expenses attributable to equity-based instruments to employees as compensation for purchased services are expensed in the periods during which the services are performed. The provision for social security expenses is based on the fair value of the share rights at each reporting period.

NOTES – GROUP

Note 1 cont.

Post-employment benefits
The Group has a number of pension schemes. The main part of Tele2's pension plans consist of defined-contribution plans (Note 31) for which the Group make payments to public and private pension institutions. Amounts paid or payable to defined-contribution pension plans are reported as an expense during the period in which the employees perform the services to which the contribution relates. The defined-contribution plans ensure a certain predefined payment of premiums and negative changes in the value of investments are not compensated by Tele2. Therefore Tele2 does not bear the risk at the time of pension payment. Only a small part of the Group's pension commitments relate to defined benefit plans. The net present value of the obligation for these are calculated separately for each defined benefit plan on the basis of assumptions of the future benefits earned during previous and current periods. The obligation is reported in the balance sheet as the net present value of the obligation less the fair value of any plan assets. The defined-benefit pension plans may be funded (partly or wholly) and non-funded. In the funded plans, assets have been separated in a pension trust. These plan assets may only be used to pay benefits under pension agreements.

The cost for the defined-benefit plans is calculated by application of the Projected Unit Credit Method, which means that the cost is distributed over the employee's period of service. The calculation is performed annually by an independent actuary. The obligation is valued at the net present value of the expected future payments, taking into account assumptions such as expected future increases in salaries, inflation, health expenses and life span. Expected future payments are discounted with an interest rate that is effective on the closing day for first class corporate bonds, if available, considering the estimated remaining tenor for each obligation. In Sweden, in line with prior years, mortgage bonds are used for determining the discount rate. The effects from revaluation are reported in other comprehensive income. For a number of the Group's employees in Sweden, the retirement pension and family pension are secured by a pension plan in Alecta. According to an announcement from the Swedish Financial Reporting Board, UFR 10, this is a defined-benefit multi-employer plan. In situations when Alecta cannot provide sufficient information to determine an individual company's share of the total obligation and its plan assets, these pensions plans are being reported as defined-contribution plans. The plans are financed by pension insurances.

Termination benefits
An expense for employee redundancy benefits is recognised at the earliest time when the entity is no longer able to withdraw the offer to employees or when the entity recognises restructuring costs. The benefits that are expected to be settled after twelve months are reported at its present value. Benefits that are not expected to be fully settled within twelve months are recognised as long-term provision.

Income tax
Income taxes consist of current and deferred tax. Income tax is reported in the income statement except when the underlying transaction is reported in other comprehensive income or in equity. In those cases the related tax effect is also reported in other comprehensive income or in equity.

Current tax is tax that is to be paid or received in respect of the taxable profit (tax loss) for the year including any adjustment of current tax related to previous periods and tax on dividends from subsidiaries.

When accounting for deferred taxes, the balance sheet method is applied. The method implies that deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognised for all temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability and its tax base, as well as other tax-related deductions or deficits. An item which alters the time when an item is taxable or deductible is considered a temporary difference. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled, based on the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period.

The recognition of deferred tax assets takes into account tax loss carry-forwards and temporary differences where it is probable that losses and temporary differences will be utilised against future taxable profits. In cases where a company reports losses, an assessment is made of whether there is any convincing evidence that there will be sufficient future profits.

If a deferred tax liability exists and tax loss carryforwards exist for which a deferred tax asset previously hasn't been recognised, a deferred tax asset is recognised for at least the extent it can be netted against the deferred tax liability.

Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are netted only among group companies within the same tax jurisdiction. This form of reporting is only applied when Tele2 intends to offset tax assets and liabilities.

Tele2 Group falls within the scope of the OECD Pillar 2 model rules, which will be entered into force 1st of January 2024. Note 10 Taxes contains more information about the legislation and the impact on Tele2.

Non-current assets
Intangible assets (Note 11) and property, plant and equipment (Note 12) owned by Tele2 with a finite useful life are reported at acquisition value with deductions for accumulated depreciation and amortisation. Depreciation and amortisation are based on the acquisition value of the assets less estimated residual value at the end of the useful life and are recognised on a straight-line basis throughout the asset's estimated useful life. Generally, the estimated residual value for intangible asset is nil. Useful lives and residual values are subject to annual assessments. Useful lives for intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are presented below.

NOTES – GROUP

Note 1 cont.

Intangible assets
| Asset Type | Useful Life |
|------------|------------|
| Licenses, utilisation rights and software | 3–25 years |
| Trademarks | 5–10 years |
| Customer agreements | 5–15 years |

Property, plant and equipment
| Asset Type | Useful Life |
|------------|------------|
| Buildings | 7–20 years |
| Customer premises equipment | 2–5 years |
| Machinery and technical plant | 2–30 years |
| Equipment and installations | 2–10 years |

At the end of each reporting period, an assessment is made of whether there is any indication of impairment of any of the Group's assets. If there is any indication that a non-current asset has declined in value, a calculation of its recoverable amount is made.

The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset's value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. The value in use consists of the present value of all cash flows from the asset during the utilisation period as well as the addition of the present value of the fair value less costs to sell at the end of the utilisation period. If the estimated recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, the asset is written down to its recoverable amount.

In the case of reorganisation or divestment involving a change in the composition of cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated, the goodwill is allocated to the relevant units. The allocation is based on the relative value of the part of the cash generating unit to which the reorganisation or divestment relates, and the part that remains after the reorganisation or the divestment.

Existing trademarks have previously been reassessed to have a definite useful life and are reported at book value at the date of reassessment less accumulated amortisation.

Customer agreements are valued at fair value in conjunction with business combinations. Tele2 applies a model where the average historical customer acquisition cost or, alternatively, the present value of expected future cash flows, is applied to value customer agreements.

Tele2 capitalizes direct development expenses for software which are specific to its operations if the recognition criteria are fulfilled. The capitalized development expenses that are not yet finalised are subject to at least annually impairment testing. The expenses are amortised over the utilisation period, which begins when the asset is ready for use. Expenses relating to the planning phase of the projects as well as expenses of maintenance and training are expensed as incurred. Other expenses relating to development work are expensed as they arise, since they do not meet the criteria for being reported as an asset.

Property, plant and equipment
Buildings relate to assets intended for use in operations. The acquisition value includes the direct costs attributable to the building.

Machinery and technical plant include equipment and machinery intended for use in operations, such as network installations. The acquisition value includes the direct costs attributable to the construction and installation of networks.

Additional costs for extension and value-increasing improvements are reported as an asset, while additional expenses are added to cost only if it is likely that the future economic benefits associated with the asset will come to Tele2 and the cost can be reliably calculated. All other additional costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they incur, e.g. repair and maintenance.

Equipment and installations comprise assets used in administration, sales and operations. Costs for equipment that are rented to or used for free by customers are capitalized.

Leases
Tele2 as lessee
For all lease agreements in which Tele2 is the lessee, a right-of-use asset (Note 13) and a corresponding lease liability (Note 29) is recognised, except for short-term leases (defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less at commencement date) and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value

NOTES – GROUP

Note 1 cont.

(with a value as new below EUR 5,000). All lease agreements are reported from the date the leased assets are available for use of the Group. For short-term leases and low value leases, the lease payments are recognised as current operating expenses in the income statement. In addition, the practical expedient in IFRS 16 to not separate lease and non-lease components in a lease contract is applied for the lease categories Sites and base stations (typically non-lease component is electricity) and Leased lines (typically non-lease component is repair and maintenance). For all other lease categories, the Group separate the lease components and exclude the service component at calculation of the lease liability. The lease term corresponds to the non-cancellable duration of the signed contracts except in cases where Tele2 is reasonably certain of exercising either an extension option or an early termination option that is included in the contract. Please refer to note 29 for information about open ended contracts.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted by using the rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate. When determining the incremental borrowing rate considerations take into account the currency in which the asset is leased, the tenor of the contract and the underlying cashflows which the lease generates. Variable rents that do not depend on an index or rate are not included in the measurement of the lease liability and the right-of-use asset. The related payments are recognised as an operating expense in the period in which the event or condition that triggers those payments occurs. The lease liability subsequently increases with the interest on the lease liability (using the effective interest method) and reduces as the lease payments are made. The lease liability is remeasured (with a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset) whenever the previously determined lease term has changed, the lease payments change due to changes in an index or rate, there is a change in the assessment of exercise of a purchase option, a change in expected payment under a guaranteed residual value, or a lease contract is modified and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease.

The right-of-use asset comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments made at or before the commencement day and any initial direct costs and are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. Whenever the Group incurs an obligation for costs to dismantle and remove a leased asset, restore the site on which it is located or restore the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease, a provision is measured and recognised. The costs are included in the related right-of-use asset, unless those costs are already included in a tangible asset. Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter period of lease term and useful life of the underlying asset.

In the cash flow statement the amortisation of the lease liability is presented in the financing activities while the interest component is presented in the operating cash flow. Short-term lease payments, payments for leases of low-value assets and variable lease payments not included in the measurement of the lease liability is presented within operating cash flow.

Tele2 lessor

Leases for which Tele2 is a lessor are classified as finance or operating leases. A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the economic risks and rewards of ownership of an asset to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. When Tele2 act as finance lessor the assets in a financial lease contract are reported in the balance sheet as a financial receivable to an amount equal to the net investment in the lease contract corresponding to the discounted net present value applying a market based discount rate and a sales revenue in accordance with the principles for customary sales. The financial income arising from a finance lease is accounted for in accordance with a constant remuneration (fixed interest rate) applying the effective interest method.

Rental revenues from operating leases are recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease, including the effect of provided benefits, which normally are accrued over the term. The leased asset is kept on the balance sheet and depreciated over its estimated useful life.

Dismantling costs

When there is a legal or constructive obligation to a third party, the estimated cost of dismantling and removing the asset and restoring the site/area is included in the acquisition value of owned and leased assets. Any change to the estimated cost of dismantling and removing an asset and restoring the site is added to or subtracted from the carrying amount of the particular asset.

Inventories

Inventories of materials and supplies are valued in accordance with the first-in, first-out principle at the lower of acquisition value and net realisable value. Tele2's inventories essentially consist of mobile phones, fixed broadband routers, digital TV boxes and IT & Network hardware.

Contract assets and contract liabilities

A contract asset is Tele2's right to payment for goods and services already transferred to the customer if that right to payment is conditional on something other than the passage of time. For example, in bundled contracts that include both equipment such as handset and telecom services, Tele2 will recognise a contract asset when it has fulfilled the contract obligation to deliver the handset but must perform the telecom service obligations before being entitled to payment. This is in contrast to a receivable, which is the right to payment that is unconditional, except for the passage of time. A contract liability is Tele2's obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer at the earlier of when the customer prepays consideration or the time that the customer's consideration is due for goods and services Tele2 will yet provide. Contract assets are included in the balance sheet items Receivable from sold equipment Note 16 and Note 20 and accrued income Note 21. Contract liabilities are included in the balance sheet item Deferred income Note 26.

NOTES – GROUP

Note 1 cont.

## Financial assets and liabilities

Acquisitions and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date, which is the date that the Group has an undertaking to acquire or sell the asset. Financial liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet when Tele2 becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

A financial asset is derecognised when the rights to receive benefits have been realised, expired or the company loses control over the asset. The same applies to components of a financial asset. In instances where Tele2 retains the contractual rights to the cash flows from a financial asset but assumes a contractual obligation to pass on those cash flows to a third party (a pass through obligation), the financial asset is only derecognised when substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset has been transferred and the following conditions exist:

- Tele2 has no obligation to pay amounts to the third party unless Tele2 collects equivalent amounts from the original asset,
- Tele2 is prohibited by the terms of the transfer arrangement from selling or pledging the original asset other than as security to the third party for the obligation to pay it cash flows, and
- Tele2 has an obligation to pass on or remit the cash flows that it has collected on behalf of the third party without material delay.

A financial liability is derecognised when the contractual obligation is discharged or extinguished in some other way. The same applies to components of a financial liability.

Financial instruments are initially recognised at the acquisition date fair value and subsequently to either fair value or amortised cost based on the initial categorisation. The categorisation reflects both the Group's business model for managing the assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets and is determined on initial recognition.

### Measurement of the fair value of financial instruments

Various measurement methods are used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments not traded on an active market. When determining the fair value of interest swaps and currency derivatives official market listings are used as input in calculations of discounted cash flows. The fair value of loan liabilities is measured using generally accepted methods, such as discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.

### Calculation of amortised cost of financial instruments

Amortised cost is calculated by using the effective interest method, which means that any premiums or discounts and directly attributable costs or income are recognised on an accrual basis over the life of the contract using the calculated effective interest rate. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liability to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the amortised cost of a financial liability.

## Offsetting financial assets and liabilities

Financial assets and liabilities are offset, and the net amount is presented in the balance sheet when a legal right to set-off exists and the Group intends to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

## Financial assets

Tele2's trade receivables and other receivables are categorised as "Assets at amortised cost" initially reported at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost. An allowance for expected credit losses has to be calculated according to IFRS 9, no matter if a loss event has occurred or not, please refer to Note 19. Tele2 applies the simplified approach to recognise expected credit losses for trade receivables and contract assets that result from transactions within the scope of IFRS 15 (Revenues from contracts with customers) and for finance lease receivables. For finance lease receivables this is a policy choice.

The simplified approach applies a matrix model and is always based on lifetime expected credit losses considering information about historical data adjusted for current conditions and forecasts of future events and economic conditions.

To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables and receivable from sold equipment have been grouped by credit risk characteristics and past due status. Tele2 has chosen to report the expected credit losses based on customer type since the risk is considered to be diverse. Business customers are defined as customer that uses Tele2's services primarily for business purposes, including public sector and non-profit organisations. A consumer is a customer who is not defined as a business customer.

The expected credit losses are based on customers' payment history during a period of between 6 to 24 months together with the historical credit losses during the same period. The historical losses are adjusted to reflect macroeconomic and forward-looking information that can affect the customers' ability to pay, such as changed market expectations and the ability to sell outstanding trade receivables. Tele2 has identified and made specific reservations for customers whose ability to pay are considered to be differentiated from other receivables. Trade receivables and receivable from sold equipment are written off when a payment no longer is considered to be likely. An indication is that the payment is more than 90 days overdue. Any impairment loss is reported as an operating expense.

Cash and cash equivalents are categorised as "Assets at amortised cost" initially reported at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and bank balances as well as current investments with a maturity of less than three months from the time of acquisition. The general impairment model in IFRS 9 is applied to cash and cash equivalents and the identified impairment loss was immaterial.

Restricted cash and cash equivalents are reported as current investments if they may be released within 12 months and as non-current financial assets if they are to be restricted for more than 12 months.

NOTES – GROUP

Note 1 cont.

Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are categorised as "Financial liabilities at amortised cost". These are initially measured at fair value and then at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Direct costs related to the origination of loans are included in the acquisition value. For trade payables and other financial debts, with a short maturity, the subsequent valuation is done at the nominal amount.

Derivatives and hedge accounting
The Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments in respect of cash flow hedges, interest rate risk in fair value hedges, and hedges of net investments in foreign operations.

At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, which is when the hedging relationships meet all of the following hedge effectiveness requirements:

- there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument;
- the effect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from that economic relationship; and
- the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the Group actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the Group actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item.

If a hedging relationship ceases to meet the hedge effectiveness requirement relating to the hedge ratio but the risk management objective for that designated hedging relationship remains the same, the Group adjusts the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship (i.e. rebalances the hedge) so that it meets the qualifying criteria again.

Furthermore, if the Group expects that some or all of the loss accumulated in cost of hedging reserve will not be recovered in the future, that amount is immediately reclassified to profit or loss. Note 2 describes the details of the fair values of the derivative instruments used for hedging purposes as well as the changes in the hedging reserve in equity.

Exchange rate fluctuations on loans in foreign currency and changes in value of other financial instruments (currency derivatives) that meet the hedge accounting requirements of net investment in foreign operations are reported on a continuous basis in other comprehensive income. The Group designates only the intrinsic value of currency swap contracts, designated for hedging of net investments in foreign operations, as a hedged item, i.e. excluding the time value of the swap. The changes in the fair value of the aligned time value of the swap are recognised in the income statement. The ineffective portion of the exchange rate fluctuation and the change in value are reported in the income statement under other financial items. When divesting foreign operations, the previously recognised accumulated exchange rate difference attributable to the divested operation is recycled to the income statement.

Cash flow hedges are reported in the same way as hedges of net investments in foreign operations. This means that the effective portion of the gain or loss on an interest swap which meets the criteria for cash-flow hedge accounting is recognised in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss within financial items. When cash flows relating to the hedged item are reported in profit or loss, amounts are transferred from equity to offset them. For more information regarding cash flow hedges, please refer to Note 2 and Note 24.

The Group discontinues hedge accounting only when the hedging relationship (or a part thereof) ceases to meet the qualifying criteria (after rebalancing, if applicable). When a hedging instrument related to future cash flows is due, sold, divested or settled or the Group discontinues the hedge relation before the hedged transaction has occurred and the forecasted transaction is still expected to occur, the accumulated reported gain or loss remains in the hedge reserve in equity and is reported in the income statement when the transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the hedging instrument's accumulated gain or loss is immediately reported in the income statement.

For fair value hedges, the effective and ineffective portions of the change in fair value of the derivative, along with the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged, are recognised in the income statement in the same line.

Other derivatives, for which hedge accounting is not applied, are measured at their fair value through profit or loss.

Receivables and liabilities in foreign currency
Receivables and liabilities of the Group denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Swedish krona by applying the period-end rates.

Gains or losses on foreign exchanges relating to regular operations are included in the income statement under Other operating income/expenses. Gains or losses on foreign exchanges in financial assets and liabilities are reported within profit/loss from financial items.

When long-term lending to/borrowing from Tele2's foreign operations is regarded as a permanent part of the parent company's financing of/borrowing from foreign operations, and thus as an expansion/reduction of the parent company's investment in the foreign operations, the exchange rate changes of these intra-group balances are reported in Other comprehensive income.

A summary of the exchange rate differences reported in other comprehensive income is presented in the statement of comprehensive income and the differences which affected profit or loss for the year are presented in Note 2.

Note 1 cont.

## Capitalized contract costs

Costs to obtain a contract are capitalized as contract costs assets. These costs are incremental costs incurred when obtaining a contract with a customer and are typically internal and external sales provisions. When businesses are acquired, customer agreements acquired as part of the acquisition are fair valued and capitalized as intangible assets.

The asset is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average customer life period if the cost is assessed as recoverable at portfolio level. Amortisation is recognised as an operating cost, in order for this cost to be reflected in the operational business.

Amortisation periods:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Consumer contracts</td>
    <td>3–24 months</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Business contracts</td>
    <td>3–36 months</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The contract asset is impaired in accordance with IFRS 15. An impairment exists if the carrying amount exceeds the amount of consideration Tele2 expects to receive in exchange for providing the associated goods and services, less the remaining costs that relate directly to providing those good and services.

## Number of shares and earnings per share

Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit or loss of the year attributable to the parent company's owners by the weighted average number of outstanding shares during the period. In calculating diluted earnings per share, earnings and the average number of shares are adjusted to take into account the effects of dilutive potential ordinary shares, which in reported periods derive from share rights issued to employees. Furthermore, the number of share rights, and hence shares, that would be vested if the level of fulfilment of the vesting conditions at the end of the current period would also exist at the end of the vesting period, are included (Note 23).

## Provisions

Provisions are reported when a company within the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, and it is probable that payments, which can be reliably estimated, will be required in order to settle the obligation.

Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense, or as interest income when appropriate.

## Equity

Equity consists of registered share capital, other paid-in capital, hedge reserve, translation reserve, retained earnings and profit/loss for the year.

Other paid-in capital relates to share premiums from the issues of new shares. Additional direct costs attributable to the issue of new shares are reported directly against equity as a reduction, net after taxes, of proceeds from the share issue.

The hedge reserve includes translation differences on external loans in foreign currencies and changes in values of financial instruments (currency derivatives) which are used to hedge net investments in foreign operations and the effective portion of gains or losses on interest swaps used to hedge future interest payments.

Translation reserve includes translation differences attributable to the translation of foreign operations into Tele2's reporting currency as well as translation differences on intra-group balances which are considered an expansion/reduction of the parent company's net investment in foreign operations.

## Contingent liabilities

A contingent liability exists if there is a possible obligation related to a past event and whose existence is confirmed only by one or several uncertain future events, and when there is an obligation that is not reported as a liability or a provision because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required, or the amount of the obligation cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability. Disclosure is presented unless the probability of an outflow of resources is remote.

## Segment reporting

### Segment
Since the risks in Tele2's operations are mainly linked to the various markets in which the company operates, Tele2 follows up and analyses its business on country level. Hence each country represents Tele2's operating segments. Tele2 has chosen Underlying EBITDAaL as the profit or loss measure for the reportable segments, please refer to the section Non-IFRS measures for the definition. The segment reporting is in line with the internal reporting to the chief operating decision maker, which is Tele2's Group Leadership Team.

Tele2 AB and other minor operations are included in segment for Sweden. Segment information is presented in Note 4. The same accounting principles are applied to the segments and the Group.

### Services
Services that are offered within the segments are mobile telephony, entertainment, fixed broadband, fixed telephony and DSL, business solutions and other operations.

The mobile service comprises various types of subscriptions for residential and business customers as well as prepaid cards. Mobile also includes mobile broadband, fixed telephony via mobile network (FVM), IoT (internet-of-things), and mobile carrier. Tele2 owns the networks.

Digital TV includes digital TV delivered via fixed infrastructure, digital terrestrial television and OTT services.

Fixed broadband includes any fixed Internet service for end-customer that is not xDSL-based (copper telephone cables) for the "last mile" connection. For Tele2 this mostly means either Vertical Fibre Coax, Fibre-to-the-Home (FTTH), or Fibre-to-the-Building (FTTB). Connection to customer can be direct access, local-loop unbundling (if not xDSL), or Open network (where Tele2 is Communication service provider).

Landlord as well as communication provider services are also offered as an integrated part of the fixed consumer operation.

Fixed telephony and DSL include resold products within fixed telephony and xDSL-based subscriber services via copper telephone cables and internet via modem.

Business solutions consists of services to business customers that are complex, and custom made, such as managed hardware, hosting, PBX services, consultancy and business LAN networks.

## Estimates and judgement of accounting principles
As part of preparing the consolidated financial statements management is required to make certain estimates and judgments. The estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and a number of other assumptions aimed at providing a decision regarding the value of the assets or liabilities which cannot be determined in any other way. The actual outcome may vary from these estimates and judgments.

The most crucial assessments and estimates used in preparing the Group's consolidated financial statements see below.

### Climate related - risks and opportunities
Tele2 works proactively to mitigate the risks associated with climate change. The company assesses that there are no material effects on the company's balance sheet as per December 31, 2023. For more information on the long term implications, see S13 in sustainability report.

### Goodwill – level for goodwill impairment testing
Goodwill arising from business combinations is allocated to the cash-generating units which are expected to receive future economic benefits, in the form of synergies, for example, from the acquired operation. If separate cash-generating units cannot be identified, goodwill is allocated to the lowest level at which the operation and its assets are monitored for internal management purposes, which is the operating segment.

### Impairment test goodwill
When estimating the recoverable amount of cash generating units for goodwill impairment purposes, the Group makes assumptions regarding future events and key parameters. The assumptions made and sensitivity analyses are disclosed in Note 11. These kinds of assessments, by nature, include some uncertainty related to projected growth rates, profit margins, investment levels and discount rates. Should the actual outcome for a specific period differ from the expected outcome, the expected future cash flows may need to be reconsidered, which could lead to a write-down.

NOTES – GROUP

Note 1 cont.

## Joint arrangements

Tele2 is part of two joint arrangements in Sweden. The arrangements concern mobile networks that are classified as joint operations and consists of Svenska UMTS-nät AB (together with Telia Company) and Net4Mobility HB (together with Telenor). Tele2 has chosen to classify these joint arrangements as joint operations as Tele2 considered that, through the agreements between the parties, they have the rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities as well as corresponding revenues and expenses related to each arrangement. As basis for the classification, additional decisive factors are that the parties in each arrangement have the rights to substantially all of the economic benefits from the assets in each operation and that the jointly owned companies are dependent on its owners for settling its liabilities on a continuous basis.

## Revenue recognition

Revenue recognition in Tele2 requires management to make judgments and estimates in a number of cases, mainly to determine fair values and the period in which the revenue should be recognised. Many agreements bundle products and services into one customer offering which for accounting purposes requires allocating revenue to each part based on its relative fair value using accounting estimates. Determining whether revenues should be recognised immediately or be deferred require management to make judgments as to when the services and equipment have been provided, the fair value of each part as well as estimates regarding the remaining contract period. Please refer to Note 16 and 20 concerning receivables for sold equipment and Note 21 for other accrued revenues.

## Valuation of acquired intangible assets

When acquiring businesses, intangible assets are measured at fair value. If there is an active market for the acquired assets, the fair value is measured based on the prices on this market. Since there are often no active markets for these assets, valuation models have been developed to estimate the fair value. Examples of valuation models are discounted cash flows models and estimates of Tele2's historical costs of acquiring equivalent assets. Please refer to Note 14 for acquisitions.

## Valuation of non-current assets with a finite useful life

If the recoverable amount falls below the book value, an impairment loss is recognised. At each balance sheet date, a number of factors are analysed in order to assess whether there is any indication of impairment. If such indication exists, an impairment test is prepared based on management's estimate of future cash flows including the applied discount rate. Please refer to Note 11, Note 12 and Note 13.

## Useful lives of non-current assets

When determining the useful life of groups of assets, historical experience and assumptions about future technical development are taken into account. Depreciation rates are based on the acquisition value of the non-current assets and the estimated utilisation period less the estimated residual value at the end of the utilisation period. If technology develops faster than expected or competition, regulatory or market conditions develop differently than expected, the Group's evaluation of utilisation periods and residual values will be influenced.

## Leases

The main judgements for leases concerns determination of whether a contract (or part of a contract) contains a lease, the lease terms and the discount rate. Regarding the lease terms, a majority of the lease contracts in Tele2 includes options either to extend or to terminate the contract. When determining the lease term, Tele2 considers all relevant facts and circumstances that creates an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination option. Economic incentive includes for example strategic plans, assessment of future technology changes, original capital invested and consideration of cost of finding and moving to a new location, any consideration of penalties Tele2 may be charged to terminate the contract and past practice regarding the period over which Tele2 has typically used particular types of assets (whether leased or owned), and economic reasons for doing so. The discount rate is determined on the basis of an estimate of the incremental borrowing rate for the current lease period and the currency. Please refer to Note 29.

## Valuation of deferred income tax receivables and uncertain tax positions

Recognition of deferred income tax takes into consideration temporary differences and unutilised loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are reported for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards only to the extent that it is considered probable that they can be utilised to offset future taxable profits. Management updates its assessments on items related to deferred income taxes and uncertain tax positions at regular intervals. The valuation of deferred tax assets is based on expectations of future results and market conditions, which are naturally subjective. The actual outcome may differ from the assessments, partly as a result of future changes in business circumstances, which were not known at the time of the assessments, changes in tax laws or interpretations or the result of the taxation authorities' or courts' final examination of submitted tax returns. Please refer to Note 10.

Note 1 cont.

### Provisions for disputes and damages

Tele2 is party to a number of disputes. For each separate dispute, an assessment of the most likely outcome is made, and reported in the consolidated financial statements, accordingly, see Note 25 and Note 28.

### Valuation of trade receivable

Accounts receivables are valued on a current basis and reported at amortised cost. Reserves for doubtful accounts are based on lifetime expected credit losses considering information about historical data adjusted for current conditions and forecasts of future events and economic conditions, see Note 19. When the receivable from sold equipment is invoiced, it is reclassified to accounts receivable.

## NOTE 2    FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Tele2's financing and financial risks are managed under the control and supervision of the Board of Directors. Financial risk management is centralised within the Treasury function. The function is responsible for the various financial risks that the Group is exposed to such as currency risk, interest risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The aim is to analyse and control the risks as set out under the current policy and guidelines as well as manage the cost of financial risk management. The risks are monitored, managed and reported on a continuous basis.

Tele2's financial assets consist mainly of receivables from end customers, other operators and resellers and cash and cash equivalents. Tele2's financial liabilities consist mainly of loans, bonds, lease liabilities and accounts payables. Classification of financial assets and liabilities including their fair value is presented below.

For the determination of fair values on financial assets and liabilities the following levels, according to IFRS 13, and inputs have been used:

1) Level 2: observable market data of interest- and foreign exchange rates are used in discounted cash flow models based on contractual cash flows to estimate the fair value of interest-, fair value- and foreign exchange rate derivatives, loans with fixed interest rate and other non-current interest bearing liabilities valued at fair value at initial recognition with subsequent measurement at amortised cost.

2) Level 3: measured at fair value through profit/loss, which on initial recognition were designated for this type of measurement. Discounted future cash flow models are used to estimate the fair value.

3) Level 3: assets classified as held for sale is earn out related to the divestment of Tele2 Germany. The fair value was based on discounted future cash flows on the assumptions further described in Note 33.

<sup>1)</sup> Reported as discontinued operations, please refer to Note 33.

Since accounts receivables, accounts payables and other current liabilities are short-term, discounting of cash flows does not cause any material differences between the fair value and carrying value.

During the year no transfers were made between the different levels in the fair value hierarchy and no significant changes were made to valuation techniques, inputs used or assumptions.

Net gains/losses on financial instruments, including assets and liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale, amounted to SEK -274 (773) million, of which loan and trade receivables amounted to SEK -149 (–121) million, derivatives to SEK-126 (894) million.

The Group has derivative contracts which are covered by master netting agreements, with the right to set off assets and liabilities with the same counterparty. This is not reflected in the accounting where gross accounting is applied. The value of reported derivatives on December 31, 2023 amounted on the asset side to SEK 89 (401) million, of which 82 (134) million is designated for hedge accounting, and on the liability side to SEK 188 (331) million, of which 188 (331) million is designated for hedge accounting.

On a continuous basis, Tele2 will diversify its financing both in terms of maturities and funding sources. A stable financial position is important in order to minimise refinancing risk. The Board of Directors reviews the capital structure annually and as needed.

Currency risk
Currency risk is the risk of changes in exchange rates having a negative impact on the Group's result and equity. Currency exposure is associated with payment flows in foreign currency (transaction exposure) and the translation of foreign subsidiaries' balance sheets and income statements to SEK (translation exposure).

The Group does not generally hedge transaction exposure. Translation exposure related to certain investments in foreign operations is hedged by issuing debt or entering into derivative transactions in the currencies involved if assessed as needed. Net investment hedges in foreign operations were 100 percent effective in 2022 and 2023 and hence no ineffectiveness was recognised in the income statement. In the hedge reserve in equity the total amount related to net investment hedges amounts to SEK -476 (-484) million. On December 31, 2023 the Group had outstanding currency derivatives as economic hedges of loans in EUR amounting to EUR 1,371 (1,184) million. The derivatives hedge monetary items thus hedge accounting is not applied. The reported fair value on the derivatives amounted to SEK -607 (265) million net.

After taking currency derivatives into account, the borrowings in SEK million are carried in the following currencies (equivalent SEK amounts).

Capital structure management
The Tele2 Group's view on capital structure management (equity and net debt) incorporates several inputs, of which the main items are listed below.

The Board of Directors of Tele2 have set the following policies for financial leverage and shareholder remuneration:
- Tele2 will seek to operate within a range for economic net debt to underlying EBITDAaL of between 2.5–3.0x, and to maintain investment grade credit metrics
- Tele2's policy will aim to maintain target leverage by distributing capital to shareholders through:
  - An ordinary dividend of at least 80 percent of equity free cash flow; and
  - Extraordinary dividends and/or share repurchases, based on remaining equity free cash flow, proceeds from asset sales and re-leveraging of underlying EBITDAaL growth

Note 2 cont.

The consolidated balance sheet and income statement are affected by a translation exposure when subsidiaries' currencies fluctuate against the Swedish krona. Revenues and operating profit are distributed among the following currencies.

A ten percent currency fluctuation of the Euro against the Swedish krona would have a translation effect on the Group's revenues and operating profit/loss by +/- SEK 681 (600) million and +/- SEK 207 (166) million, respectively.

Exchange rate differences which arise in operations are reported in the income statement and totals to the following amounts.

<sup>1)</sup> Loans denominated in EUR designated for net investment hedging are included by SEK 3,606 (3,617) million.

A ten percent currency fluctuation against the Swedish krona would affect the Group's total net assets by SEK 226 (301) million. A strengthening of the SEK towards other currencies would impact net assets negatively.

## Interest rate risk

Tele2 is exposed to interest rate risk because the Group borrows with both fixed and floating interest rates. The risk is managed by maintaining an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings and by the using of interest rate swaps. The risk is monitored and evaluated regularly to align with the interest duration strategy, ensuring the most cost-effective strategy is applied.

Tele2 is exposed to the following interest rate benchmarks within its hedge accounting relationships, which are subject to interest rate benchmark reform: EURIBOR and STIBOR (collectively 'IBORs'). As listed below, the hedged items include issued EUR fixed rate debt and issued SEK floating rate debt. Tele2 closely monitors the market and the output from the various industry working groups managing the transition to new benchmark interest rates. This includes announcements made by the IBOR regulators. None of the Group's current EURIBOR and STIBOR linked contracts include adequate and robust fall back provisions for a cessation of the referenced benchmark interest rate. Different working groups in the industry are working on fall back language for different instruments and different IBORs, which Tele2 is monitoring closely and will look to implement when appropriate. For Tele2's derivatives, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association's (ISDA) fall back protocol was made available on October 23, 2020. Tele2 has ongoing discussions with its banks with the aim to implement this language into its ISDA agreements before the transition to new benchmark interest rates is carried out.

Interest bearing financial liabilities exposed to changes in interest rates over the next 12 months (i.e. short fixed interest rates) amounted to SEK 13,653 (12,216) million in carrying value, corresponding to 43 (37) percent of outstanding debt balance at the end of the year. Calculated at floating interest-bearing liabilities on December 31, 2023 and assuming that loans carrying short fixed interest rates were traded per January 1, 2023 to 1 percentage point higher interest rate and this rate was constant for 12 months, this would result in an additional interest expense for 2023 of SEK 137 (122) million, and affect profit/loss after tax negatively by SEK 108 (97) million and other comprehensive income positively by SEK 26 (30) million in 2023. For additional information please refer to Note 24.

The capital amount of outstanding interest rate derivatives on December 31, 2023 amounts to SEK 1.0 (1.0) billion converting floating interest rate to fixed interest rate and EUR 250 million, equivalent to SEK 2.8 billion, converting fixed rate to floating. The cash flows related to outstanding interest rate derivatives are expected to affect the income statement during the remaining duration of the interest rate swaps. The Group will settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.

Outstanding interest rate derivatives for cash flow and fair value hedging are presented below.

### Liquidity risk

The Group's excess liquidity is invested on a short-term basis or used for loan repayments. Liquidity reserves consist of available cash, undrawn committed credit facilities and committed overdraft facilities. At the end of 2023, the Group had available liquidity reserves of SEK 10.1 (9.7) billion. For additional information please refer to Note 22.

Tele2 transfers the right for payment of certain operating receivables to financial institutions. During 2023 the right of payment transferred to third parties without recourse or remaining credit exposure for Tele2 corresponded to SEK 2,947 (2,549) million.

As of the date of this report, Tele2 has a sustainability linked Credit Facility with a syndicate of eight relationship banks. In December 2023, the Facility was extended by one year to 2028 and has one remaining one year extension option. The Facility amounts to EUR 700 million and was unutilised on December 31, 2023.

Tele2 AB's EUR 5 billion Euro Medium-Term Note (EMTN) Program forms the basis for Tele2's medium- and long-term debt issuance in both international and domestic bond markets. On December 31, 2023 issued bonds under the Program amounted to SEK 23,113 (22,475) million. For additional information please refer to Note 24.

Undiscounted contractual commitments are presented below. The contractual maturity is based on the earliest date on which the Group may be required to pay.

NOTES - GROUP

Note 2 cont.

Credit risk

Tele2's credit risk is mainly associated with accounts receivables, receivables related to sold equipment (handsets), cash and cash equivalents and financial derivatives with a positive mark-to-mark valuation not included under CSA agreements. The Group regularly assesses its credit risk arising from accounts receivables and receivables related to sold equipment. As the customer base is highly diversified and includes individuals and companies, the exposure and associated overall credit risk is limited. Companies within the Group are entitled to sell overdue receivables to debt collection agencies either as a one-time occasion or on ongoing basis if favourable. The Group makes provisions for expected credit losses, please refer to Note 19.

Maximum credit exposure for accounts receivables amounts to SEK 2,111 (1,986) million and receivables related to sold equipment to SEK 1,755 (1,790) million.

The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with solid, stable credit-ratings assigned by credible international credit-rating agencies. The Group has entered into ISDA agreements for derivative contracts with all counterparty banks that have derivatives with the Group. Under the terms of these arrangements, only where certain credit events occur (such as default), the net position owing/receivable to a single counterparty in the same currency will be taken as owing and all the relevant arrangements terminated. As Tele2 presently does not have legally enforceable right to set off, these amounts have not been offset in the balance sheet.

A Credit Support Annex (CSA) has in some cases also been entered into with counterparties. Under CSA agreements the parties have agreed to exchange collateral corresponding to the market value of outstanding derivatives. Receivables from financial institutions in the form of cash pledged as collateral to reduce credit risk amounted on December 31, 2023 to SEK 84 (156) million. Maximum credit exposure for liquid funds amounted to SEK 1,634 (1,116) million and derivatives to SEK 0 (0) million.

As of December 31, 2023, Tele2 had non-cancellable customer contracts with a duration up to 120 (120) months, which resulted in partly unsatisfied performance obligations at year end. 51 (49) percent of the transaction price allocated to the partly unsatisfied contracts as of December 31, 2023 is expected to be recognised as revenue during the year 2024 (2023). 34 (32) percent is expected to be recognised during 2025 (2024) and 15 (19) percent during 2026–2033 (2025–2032).

All usage-based revenue is excluded from this disclosure as that revenue is not fixed in a contract. Tele2 does not include binding revenue with an outstanding contract period of 12 months or less. Since Tele2 does not include all contracts and has also cancellable subscriptions, the amount of outstanding unsatisfied performance obligation does not amount to expected revenue for future periods.

Pillar 2 legislation

The Tele2 Group falls within the scope of the OECD Pillar 2 model rules. Pillar 2 legislation is implemented in Sweden through the Law on Top-up Tax (Sw. "Lag om tilläggsskatt"), the jurisdiction where Tele 2 AB, the parent company of the Group, is incorporated. The Swedish Pillar 2 legislation entered into force 1st of January 2024 and applies to fiscal years beginning after 31 December 2023. Since the regulations were not in effect at the reporting date, Tele2 has not reported any current top-up tax.

Under Pillar 2, Tele2 is liable to pay top-up tax for jurisdictions where Tele2 has low-taxed operations. Operations are deemed as low-taxed if Tele2's effective tax rate in a jurisdiction, calculated in accordance with the certain rules of Pillar 2, falls below the minimum tax rate of 15% (the "Main Rule"). Pillar 2 also includes temporary safe harbour rules which, if fulfilled for a particular jurisdiction, implies that the top-up tax for the jurisdiction is deemed SEK 0.

Deferred tax assets were reported for deductible temporary differences and tax loss carry-forwards to the extent convincing evidence showed that these can be utilised against future taxable profits.

Tax disputes
In March 2019, the Swedish Tax Agency rejected Tele2's claim for a deduction of an exchange loss related to a conversion of a shareholder loan from USD to Kazakh Tenge in connection with the establishment of Tele2's previous joint venture in Kazakhstan. Tele2 appealed the decision and the Administrative Court of Appeal ruled completely in favor of Tele2 in November 2022. The judgment became final and Tele2 released the provision of in total SEK 363 million in 2022.

management's assessment of market-specific risks and opportunities, including expected changes in competition, the business model used by Tele2 and the regulatory environment. The discount rate takes into account the prevailing interest rates and specific risk factors in a particular cash generating unit. The discount rate post tax (WACC) varies between 8 and 11 (8 and 11) percent. Tele2 calculates future cash flows based on the most recent three-year plan. For the period after this, annual perpetuity growth of 0 to 2 (0 to 2) percent is assumed. These rates do not exceed the average long-term growth for the sector as a whole nor do they exceed the expected long term GDP growth rates in each market.

In 2023 we have considered the challenging macro-economic situation, including increasing interest rates, as well as the uncertain geopolitical environment in the valuation of our operations. In our assumptions for operational performance, we have considered increasing costs driven by inflationary pressure as well as higher network investments in the near term driven by regulation in Sweden. However, we see that our business model is resilient, offering services that are highly valued and prioritised by our customers. In addition, the segments carry fairly prudent values in our balance sheet, and our sensitivity analysis shows that no changes within reason to important parameters would trigger an impairment. Accordingly, we have concluded that no goodwill impairment is needed.

The value in used calculations are based on the following assumptions per operating segment:

Goodwill

In connection with the acquisition of operations, goodwill is allocated to the cash generating units that are expected to receive future financial benefits, such as synergies, as a result of the acquired operations. In the event that separate cash generating units cannot be identified, goodwill is allocated to the lowest level at which the operation and its assets are controlled and monitored internally, which is on operating segment level.

Goodwill impairment test

Tele2 tests goodwill (and if applicable other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives) for impairment annually, by comparing the carrying amount with the recoverable value for the cash generating units to which these assets are allocated. The recoverable value of the respective cash generating unit is based on the higher of estimated value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. For all cash generating units the recoverable values have been determined based on value in use. The key assumptions used in the calculations of values in use are growth rates, profit margins, investment levels and discount rates. The expected revenue growth rates, profit margins and investment levels are based on sector data as well as

Trademarks

In addition to goodwill, the Com Hem brand was previously assessed to have an indefinite useful life. This asset originates from the merger with Com Hem in 2018. However, in Q2 2021 our consumer premium brands Com Hem and Tele2 were merged. We are not scrapping one brand, but rather bring the best from the two brands into the new merged brand named Tele2. Key premium attributes from the Com Hem brand, including the logotype dots, are secured. The Com Hem brand had as per the reassessment date a carrying amount of SEK 5,383 million, or SEK 4,274 million net of tax. The brand positioning has led to a reassessment of the Com Hem brand useful life from the previous assessment of indefinite life to definite. Based on an overall analysis of all relevant facts and circumstances Tele2 has determined that the useful life of Com Hem brand would be 10 years from the date of reassessment from indefinite life to definite life. Accordingly, amortisation of the Com Hem brand book value was initiated in Q2 2021. In 2023, the amortisation had a negative impact on operating profit and net result of SEK 538 (538) million and SEK 427 (427) million respectively. As per December 31, 2023 the Com Hem brand has accordingly a carrying amount of SEK 3,947 (4,486) million, or SEK 3,134 (3,562) million net of tax.

Divestments
In Q1 2022, the divestment of T-Mobile Netherlands was completed. The cash proceeds for Tele2's 25% share of the company amounted to SEK 9.0 billion. In addition, FX hedges attached to the transaction have affected exchange rate differences in the cash flow statement with SEK -153 million in Q4 2021 and SEK 125 million in the first half of 2022.

The proceeds from Tele2 Germany refer to the earnout arrangement, which was part of the divestment in 2020.

For further information related to discontinued operations, see note 33.

Receivable from sold equipment consists of instalment which is referring to equipment sold, such as handsets and other equipment. The equipment has been supplied to the customer and revenue has been recognised. None of these receivables were due on the closing date. When the invoicing occurs, the amount invoiced is transferred from receivable from sold equipment to trade receivables. The item also consists of effects of the time difference between when the performance obligation is satisfied and revenue recognised for the goods or service and the payments to be received. The contract asset arises due to sales of bundles. For information regarding loss allowance please refer to Note 19.

## Proposed appropriation of profit

The Board proposes that, from the SEK 33,789,264,331 at the disposal of the Annual General Meeting, an ordinary dividend of SEK 6.90 per share should be paid to shareholders in two tranches in May and October 2024, corresponding to SEK 4,772,268,231 on December 31, 2023. The remaining amount, SEK 29,016,996,099, should be carried forward.

Based on this annual report, the consolidated financial statements and other information which has become available, the Board has considered all aspects of the parent company's and the Group's financial position. This evaluation has led the Board to the conclusion that the dividend is justifiable in view of the requirements that the nature and scope of and risks involved in Tele2's operations have on the size of the company's and the Group's equity as well as on its consolidation needs, liquidity and financial position in general.

For information regarding dividend policy please refer to Note 2.

Tele2 AB's established Swedish commercial paper program enables Tele2 to issue commercial papers up to a total amount of SEK 8 billion. Commercial papers can be issued with a tenor up to 12 months under the program. The commercial paper program is a complement to Tele2's core funding. On December 31, 2023 Tele2 had SEK 0 (796) million outstanding commercial papers.

As part of our vision to lead in sustainability Tele2 launched a combined Green and Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework. The Tele2 Framework is linked to its sustainability strategy and builds on the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. Under the framework, Tele2 can issue Green- and Sustainability Linked bonds connected to the company's overall sustainability performance.

As a further step towards the diversification of Tele2's funding sources, Tele2 AB has a loan agreement with Nordic Investment Bank (NIB) of SEK 1.8 (2.0) billion and a loan agreement with the European Investment Bank (EIB) of EUR 125 (125) million.

The average interest rate on loans outstanding at the end of the year was 3.2 (2.1) percent.

As of the date of this report, Tele2 has a credit facility with a syndicate of eight banks maturing in 2028. The loans can be drawn in several currencies and the interest base is the relevant IBOR for that currency. The facility amounts to EUR 700 million and was unutilised on December 31, 2023 and prepaid upfront fees to be recognised in profit/loss over the remaining contract period amounted to SEK 23 (26) million. The facility is conditioned by covenant requirements which Tele2 expects to fulfil.

Tele2 AB's Euro Medium-Term Note (EMTN) Program forms the basis for Tele2's medium and long term debt issuance in both international and domestic bond markets. The program enables Tele2 to issue bonds and notes up to a total aggregate amount of EUR 5 billion. On December 31, 2023 bonds issued under the program amounted to SEK 23.1 (22.5) billion.

Derivatives consist of interest swaps and currency swaps, valued at fair value. The effective part of the swaps was reported in the hedge reserve in other comprehensive income and the ineffective part was reported as interest costs and other financial items, respectively, in the income statement. The Group has derivative contracts which are covered by master netting agreements. That means a right exists to set off assets and liabilities with the same party, which is not reflected in the accounting where gross accounting is applied. To minimise counterparty risk, Tele2 has also entered into CSA agreements where collateral equal to the market value of the derivatives are exchanged from time to time. For additional information please refer to Note 2.

For information on leases please refer to Note 29.

NOTE 29 LEASES

Tele2 as the lessee

Tele2's leases consist mainly of lease of sites and base stations (including land), leased lines, premises, vehicles and other equipment. The additions consisting of new and modified leases amounted to SEK 420 (1,370) million. In 2023 Tele2 updated the assumptions for certain uncommitted lease contracts which reduced the expected lifetime and impacted 2023 years additions. The carrying value of the lease assets are stated in Note 13. Many of the leases across the Group are open ended contracts, that run until either party terminate, or contain extension and termination options. These terms are reflected in measuring the lease liabilities especially for the lease categories sites and base stations and leased lines, as the options are reasonably certain to be exercised based on Tele2's strategic plans, including assessment of future technology changes, and the importance of the underlying assets for the Group as well as costs associated with not extending the lease. The lease contracts contain no residual value guarantees.

Most of Tele2 employees are in a defined contribution pension plan, with the majority in ITP1. Through previous acquisitions and historically, Tele2 has allowed defined pension plans.

The defined benefit plans relate essentially to Sweden, where companies included in the Group are affiliated to PRI Pensionsgaranti or Skandia. For companies affiliated to PRI Pensionsgaranti, the companies' obligation under the ITP-plan (ITP2) retirement pension are recognised as a liability in the balance sheet. A part of the liability for retirement pension is closed for new entries and instead premiums are paid to Collectum and Alecta for the employees. Additional information regarding the defined-benefit retirement plans is shown in the following tables.

The defined-benefit pension plans under ITP2 are partly funded, where Tele2's assets have been invested in Skandia and by securing in Tele2 Joint Pension Fund. At December 31, 2023 the market value of Tele2's asset amounted to SEK 573 (521) million. Two smaller defined benefit plans of SEK 2 (2) million for management pension and conditional early retirement pension are non-funded.

The defined benefit pension obligation in Sweden is calculated using a discount rate based on interest on mortgage bonds. The Swedish covered mortgage bonds are considered high-quality bonds, the market is considered deep and the bonds are issued by large banks, thereby meeting IAS 19 requirements. The following key actuarial assumptions have been applied to calculate the commitments.

### Guidelines for remuneration to senior executives

The current guidelines for remuneration to senior executives were approved by the Annual General Meeting 2023 and are presented below.

Note 31 cont.

Applicability

Senior executives covered by the provisions of these guidelines include the CEO and members of the Group Leadership Team ("senior executives"). For the purpose of these guidelines, senior executives also include Board Members, elected at General Meetings, to the extent such Board Members perform services within their respective areas of expertise outside of their Board duties. The guidelines are forward-looking, i.e. they are applicable to remuneration agreed, and amendments to remuneration already agreed, after adoption of the guidelines by the Annual General Meeting 2023. These guidelines do not impose restrictions to any remuneration decided or approved by General Meetings. Remuneration under employments subject to other rules than Swedish may be duly adjusted to comply with mandatory rules or established local practice, taking into account, to the extent possible, the overall purpose of these guidelines.

Our approach to the remuneration guidelines

The remuneration policy provides a structure that aligns remuneration with the successful delivery of our long-term business strategy, interests and sustainability.

A prerequisite for the successful implementation of the company's business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests and its sustainability, is that the company is able to attract and retain driven and engaged talent. To this end, it is necessary that the company offers competitive remuneration packages to attract, motivate and retain key employees within the context of an international peer group. The aim is to create incentives for the management to execute strategic plans and deliver excellent operating results, and to align management's incentives with the interests of the shareholders. For more information regarding the company's business strategy, please see www.tele2.com and the company's annual and sustainability report.

General Meetings in Tele2 have separately resolved on long-term share and share-price related incentive plans. Going forward, any new long-term share and share-price related incentive plans will be resolved upon separately by General Meetings and are therefore not covered by these guidelines since these guidelines do not impose restrictions to any remuneration decided or approved by General Meetings. The performance criteria used to assess the outcome of these long-term share and share-price related incentive plans are distinctly linked to the business strategy and thereby to the company's long-term value creation, including its sustainability. At present, these performance criteria comprise Tele2's absolute TSR, Tele2's TSR vs a defined Peer Group and Tele2s cashflow. However, such criteria may change in future long-term share and share-price related incentive plans. Current plans are also conditional upon the participant's own investment and certain holding periods of several years. For more information regarding these long-term share-related incentive plans, including the performance criteria which the outcome depends on, please see www.tele2.com.

Remuneration elements

Remuneration to the senior executives should comprise annual fixed base salary, variable short-term remuneration, variable long-term incentives, pension benefits and other benefits.

Annual fixed base salary

For defining the annual fixed base salary for the senior executives, the Remuneration Committee uses a similar methodology as for benchmarking other employees' fixed annual remuneration, utilising external benchmarks within the Telecom, Hi-Tech and General industry and reviewing peer companies. The Board considers the remuneration of employees and the average annual increases an important element in determining the annual salary increase for senior executives.

Variable short-term remuneration, including criteria for awarding

The variable short-term remuneration ("STI") shall be linked to predetermined and measurable criteria, measured over a period of maximum one year, which can be financial, such as EBITDA or revenue, or non-financial, such as sustainability. In addition, they may be individualised, quantitative or qualitative objectives. For senior executives, the financial criteria are weighted 80 percent and the non-financial criteria are weighted 20 percent. The criteria shall be designed to contribute to the company's business strategy and long-term interests, including its sustainability, by for example being clearly linked to the business strategy or promote the senior executive's long-term development.

The variable short-term remuneration can amount to a maximum of 100 percent of the annual fixed base salary.

To which extent the criteria for awarding variable cash remuneration has been satisfied shall be evaluated and/or determined when the measurement period has ended. The remuneration committee is responsible for the evaluation so far as it concerns variable cash remuneration to the senior executives. The evaluation for financial objectives shall be based on the latest financial information made public by the company.

Variable long-term incentives, including criteria for awarding

The structure of any variable long-term incentives shall ensure a long-term commitment for Tele2's development and value creation and may be both share and share-price related as well as cash based. Going forward, any long-term share and share-price related incentive plans will be resolved upon separately by General Meetings and are therefore not covered by these guidelines.

Pension benefits

The senior executives are offered defined contribution pension plans, including health insurance. Defined contributions for pensions to the CEO and the other senior executives can amount to a maximum

TELE2 ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023
138

Note 31 cont.

of 20 percent premium based on the annual fixed base salary and the STI, which could maximum lead to 40 percent contribution of the annual fixed base salary.

Other benefits
Other benefits may include e.g. car benefits, health care insurance and for expatriated senior executives e.g. housing benefits for a limited period of time. Such benefits may amount to not more than five percent of the annual fixed base salary.

Termination of employment
The maximum period of notice of termination of employment shall be twelve months in the event of termination by the CEO and six months in the event of termination by any of the other senior executives.
   In the event of termination by the company, the maximum notice period during which compensation is payable is eighteen months for the CEO and twelve months for any of the other senior executives.
   Additionally, remuneration may be paid for non-compete undertakings and such remuneration shall compensate loss of income. The remuneration shall be paid during the time the non-compete undertaking applies, however not for more than six months. With regard to the CEO, the remuneration shall amount to not more than 60 percent of the CEO's average monthly remuneration (both fixed and variable) paid by the company during the twelve months preceding the time of termination and with regard to other senior executives, the remuneration shall amount to not more than 80 percent of the senior executive's monthly base salary at the time of the termination.

Salary and employment conditions for employees
In the preparation of the Board's proposal for these remuneration guidelines, salary and employment conditions for employees of the company have been taken into account by including information on the employees' total income, the components of the remuneration and increase and growth rate over time, in the remuneration committee's and the Board's basis of decision when evaluating whether the guidelines and the limitations set out herein are reasonable. The development of the gap between the remuneration to executives and remuneration to other employees will be disclosed in the remuneration report.

The decision-making process to determine, review and implement the guidelines
The Board has established a remuneration committee. The committee's tasks include preparing the Board's decision to propose guidelines for remuneration to senior executives. The Board shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines at least every fourth year and submit it to the General Meeting. The guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines are adopted by the General Meeting. The remuneration committee shall also monitor and evaluate programs for variable remuneration for the senior executives, the application of the guidelines for remuneration to senior executives as well as the current remuneration structures and compensation levels in the company. The members of the remuneration committee are independent of the company and its executive management. The CEO and other senior executives do not participate in the Board's processing of and resolutions regarding remuneration-related matters in so far as they are affected by such matters.

Derogation from the guidelines
The Board may temporarily resolve to derogate from the guidelines, in whole or in part, if in a specific case there is special cause for the derogation and a derogation is necessary to serve the company's long-term interests, including its sustainability, or to ensure the company's financial viability. As set out above, the remuneration committee's tasks include preparing the Board's resolutions in remuneration-related matters. This includes any resolutions to derogate from the guidelines.

Deviations from guidelines for remuneration to senior executives
According to the remuneration guidelines, the Board may temporarily resolve to deviate from the guidelines, in whole or in part, if in a specific case there is special cause for the deviation and a deviation is necessary to serve the company's long-term interests, including its sustainability, or to ensure the company's financial viability. In 2021, the Board resolved to deviate from the guidelines in two instances. First, the Board awarded a new variable short term incentive, the One Time Transformation Award to the senior executives that was measured over two and a half financial years and not one year as stated in the guidelines. Further, in respect of the CEO, for 2022 and 2023, the variable short-term remuneration could amount to maximum 175 percent of the annual fixed base salary, due to the implementation of the One Time Transformation Award, whilst the maximum outcome in the guidelines is set to 100 percent. For three Group Executives the implementation of the One Time transformation award, could lead to a payout of maximum 115% of short-term variable remuneration in relation to the annual fixed base salary, during two years.

In view of the importance that the Company should reach the Business Transformation Program communicated to the market as well as attributes to Group Executives and selected key individual's continued service for the Company, the Board of Directors of Tele2 decided to introduce the One Time Transformation Award to senior executives and selected key individuals. The One time Transformation award was implemented in 2021 vested Q2 2023, and was paid in 2023. Payment under the one Time Transformation award corresponded to 6-18 months base salary per participant, paid at completion of the Transformation project in 2023. The One time Transformation Award was conditional upon the participant being continuously employed during the vesting period and the defined goal for Transformation established was reached. The defined goal was to reach the cost savings in line with the externally communicated Business Transformation Program. The CEO had in addition one KPI, part of One Time Transformation Award, which was the delivery of the of Tele2 Group revenue target during the vesting period.

By offering an allotment of retention rights and performance rights which are based on profits and other retention and performance-based conditions, the participants are rewarded for increasing shareholder value. Furthermore, the program rewards employees' loyalty and long-term growth in the Group. In that context, the Board of Directors is of the opinion that the program will have a positive effect on the future development of the Tele2 Group and thus be beneficial to both the company and its shareholders.

The LTI programs are usually launched annually after approval from the Annual General Meeting, and run for around 3 years. In 2023, LTI 2020 was finalised and LTI 2023 was launched.

Outcome LTI 2020

The exercise of the share rights in LTI 2020 was conditional upon the fulfilment of certain retention and performance based conditions. The TSR criterias (serie A and B below) were measured from April 1, 2020 until March 31, 2023, while operating cash-flow (serie C below) was measured from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2022. The outcome of these performance conditions was in accordance with below and 621,710 share rights was exchanged for shares in Tele2 during Q2 2023.

Long-term incentive programs (LTI)

The objective of the long-term incentive programs (LTI) is to create conditions for retaining competent employees in the Tele2 Group. The program has been designed based on the view that it is desirable that senior executives and other key employees within the Group are shareholders in Tele2 AB. Participation in the Long-term Incentive plan requires a personal investment in Tele2 shares, by shares already held or shares purchased on the market in connection with the application to participate in the Long-term Incentive plan.

LTI 2023

At the Annual General Meeting held on May 15, 2023, the shareholders approved a retention and performance based incentive program (LTI 2023) for senior executives and other key employees in the Tele2 Group. In order to participate in the program, participants must own Tele2 Class B shares, which give the participants retention and performance rights. Subject to fulfilment of certain retention and performance based conditions during the periods January 1, 2023 – December 31, 2025 (the "Cash flow Measurement Period") and April 1, 2023 – March 31, 2026 (the "TSR Measurement Period") and the participant maintaining the invested shares at the release of the interim report for January – March 2026 and, with certain exceptions, as well maintaining the employment within the Tele2 Group, each right entitles the participant to receive one Tele2 share free of charge (subject to income taxation).

Total costs before tax for outstanding rights in the incentive program are expensed over the three year vesting period. These costs are expected to amount to SEK 101 million, of which social security costs amount to SEK 34 million. To ensure the delivery of Class B shares under the program, the Annual General Meeting decided to authorise the Board of Directors to resolve on a directed share issue of a maximum of 700,000 Class C shares and subsequently to repurchase the Class C shares. The Board of Directors has not yet used its mandate.

### Tele2 Germany

The purchase price included an earnout component, dependent upon the financial performance of the business until the end of 2024. In 2023 Tele2 has received earnout payments of SEK 54 million, which was the final payment as the maximum accumulated proceeds of SEK 205 million have been reached.

### Tele2 Croatia

In March 2020 Tele2 completed the divestment of its Croatian business to United Group. During 2022 an amount of SEK 8 million has been expensed related to an ongoing dispute, including FX effects on existing provisions.

### Tele2 Kazakhstan

In March 2019, the Swedish Tax Agency rejected Tele2's claim for a deduction of an exchange loss related to a conversion of a shareholder loan from USD to Kazakh Tenge in connection with the establishment of Tele2's previous joint venture in Kazakhstan. Tele2 appealed the decision and in November 2022 the Administrative Court of Appeal ruled completely in favour of Tele2. Accordingly, Tele2 decided to release the provision of SEK 363 million, divided on interest expenses SEK 25 million and income tax on capital gain SEK 337 million.

### Tele2 Netherlands

In January 2019 Tele2 and Deutsche Telekom completed the combination of Tele2 Netherlands and T-Mobile Netherlands. Tele2 Netherlands was sold for SEK 1.9 billion and 25 percent share in the combined company. In 2021 Tele2 reported a positive impact of SEK 130 million related to a dispute attached to the former Tele2 operation in the Netherlands, as the dispute is now resolved.
