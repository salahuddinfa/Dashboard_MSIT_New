In prior periods we had considered the functional currency of an intermediate subsidiary holding the Group's investment in HDFC Life to be US Dollars. We now consider that the functional currency should have been GBP, resulting in the transfer between reserves. Prior periods were not restated as the impact on prior periods was not considered material. There was no impact on net assets for any period presented.

# Presentation of consolidated financial statements

The Group's significant accounting policies are included at the beginning of the relevant notes to the consolidated financial statements. This section sets out the basis of preparation, a summary of the Group's critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies, and other significant accounting policies which have been applied to the financial statements as a whole.

**(a) Basis of preparation**

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of owner-occupied property, derivative instruments and other financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).

Climate risks have been taken into consideration in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, primarily in relation to fair value calculations and impairment assessments. Refer Note 34(a) for further details of our consideration of climate impact including our current assessment that the impact on the consolidated financial statements is not material.

The current inflationary environment has also been taken into consideration in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Again this primarily relates to fair value calculations and impairment assessments. The impact of inflation has been factored into budgeted cash flows used in these calculations and assessment. However, terminal growth rates are still based on longer term inflation expectations which are largely unchanged.

The principal accounting policies set out in these consolidated financial statements have been consistently applied to all financial reporting periods presented except as described below.

**(a)(i) New standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards that have been adopted by the Group**

The Group has adopted the following new International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), interpretations and amendments to existing standards, which are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023.

**IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts**

On 1 January 2023, the Group adopted IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts. IFRS 17 replaces IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts which was an interim standard which permitted the continued application of accounting policies, for insurance contracts and contracts with discretionary participation features, which were being used at transition to IFRS except where a change satisfied criteria set out in IFRS 4. IFRS 17 introduces new required measurement and presentation accounting policies for such contracts which reflect the view that these contracts combine features of a financial instrument and a service contract.

IFRS 17's measurement model, which applies to groups of contracts, combines a risk-adjusted present value of future cash flows and an amount representing unearned profit. IFRS 17 introduces a new approach to presentation in the income statement and statement of comprehensive income in relation to direct exposure to insurance contracts.

The Group has no material direct exposure to insurance contracts and contracts with discretionary participating features and the adoption of this standard has had no significant direct impact on the measurement or presentation of insurance contracts and therefore no restatement of prior periods was required in relation to direct exposure.

However, the results of the Group's joint venture Heng An Standard Life Insurance Company Limited (HASL) have been impacted by the adoption of IFRS 17 on 1 January 2023. HASL has also applied IFRS 9 Financial Instruments on 1 January 2023. While the Group had adopted IFRS 9 on 1 January 2019 following the sale of its UK and European insurance in 2018, HASL had continued to take the permitted temporary exemption granted to insurers in IFRS 4 to defer the implementation of IFRS 9 until the implementation of IFRS 17.

IFRS 17 must be applied retrospectively, however as permitted by the standard, HASL has applied IFRS 9 prospectively. Consequently, the combined impact of the change of accounting policy comes through at 1 January 2023. The net impact of the changes is an increase in the carrying value of HASL, the Group's retained earnings and net assets of £16m, comprising a decrease of £35m for IFRS 17 offset by an increase of £51m for IFRS 9.

IFRS 17 has three main measurement models: the general measurement model; the variable fee approach and the premium allocation approach. HASL is primarily using the general measurement model for its traditional insurance business and the variable fee approach for its direct participating contracts and investment contracts with direct participation features with some use of the premium allocation approach. The results reflect the election to take the other comprehensive income (OCI) options under IFRS 17 to take elements of the movements in the measurement of insurance contract through OCI to minimise income statement volatility.

# Group financial statements continued

The impact of the restatement in 2022 below partly reflects that the measurement of investment contracts under the variable fee approach reflect the fair value of the underlying assets from 1 January 2022 but a number of these assets were not accounted for at fair value until 1 January 2023 upon HASL's adoption of IFRS 9 (see below). The measurement of the insurance contracts is also impacted by the use of lower discount rates to discount liabilities under IFRS 17 as compared to those used under IFRS 4 and higher liabilities for financial related guarantees within some products.

In relation to IFRS 9, the largest impact relates to its debt investments which were classified as held to maturity under IAS 39 and subsequently accounted for at amortised cost but are now classified as fair value through OCI under IFRS 9.

As noted above, IFRS 17 is applied retrospectively. However, it was not practicable for HASL to apply a full retrospective approach. Depending on the nature and start date of the insurance contract, HASL has applied either a modified retrospective approach or a fair value approach. The choice of transition approach is not expected to have a significant impact on future periods.

The carrying value of the joint venture and opening retained earnings as at 1 January 2022 have been restated for IFRS 17.

## Amendments to existing standards
**International Tax Reform – Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Pillar Two Model Rules - Amendments to IAS 12**  
In May 2023, amendments to IAS 12 were issued which were endorsed by the UK endorsement board on 19 July 2023. The amendments were effective immediately.

The amendments clarify that IAS 12 applies to income taxes arising from tax law enacted or substantively enacted to implement the Pillar Two Model Rules published by the OECD, including tax law that implements qualified domestic minimum top-up taxes. However, the amendments also introduce a mandatory exception in IAS 12 from recognising and disclosing deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes which the Group has applied.

The amendments introduce new disclosure requirements in relation to Pillar Two income taxes including qualitative and quantitative information about Group's exposure to Pillar Two income taxes in relation to Pillar Two legislation enacted or substantively enacted but not yet effective at the end of the reporting period. Refer Note 9(e) for the information on this exposure.

**Other amendments**
- Disclosure of Accounting Policies - Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2.
- Definition of Accounting Estimates - Amendments to IAS 8.
- Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction – Amendments to IAS 12.

The Group's accounting policies have been updated to reflect these other amendments. Management considers the implementation of the above amendments to existing standards has had no significant impact on the Group's financial statements.

**(a)(ii) Standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group**

Certain new standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for the Group's annual accounting periods beginning after 1 January 2023. The Group has not early adopted the standards, amendments and interpretations described below.

There are no other new standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards that have been published that are expected to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.

# Group financial statements continued 

(a)(iii) Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies
The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgements in applying accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses arising during the year. Judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty are continually evaluated and based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

The areas where judgements have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements are as follows:

| Financial statement area | Critical judgements in applying accounting policies | Related note |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Defined benefit pension plans | Assessment of whether the Group has an unconditional right to a refund of the surplus. Treatment of tax relating to the surplus. | Note 31 |
| Intangible assets | Identification and valuation of intangible assets arising from business combinations, and the determination of useful lives. | Note 13 |

The following changes have been made to the Group's critical judgements:
- In addition to identification and valuation of the intangible assets, the allocation to cash generating units of goodwill arising from the acquisition was considered a critical judgement during 2022 in relation to the acquisition of ii (refer Note 1(b)(ii)). This is not considered as a critical judgement in relation to the 2023 acquisition of the healthcare fund management capabilities of Tekla Capital Management LLC (Tekla) (refer Note 1(b)(i)).
- Following the final release of the Group's separation costs provision (refer Note 33 for further details), determining whether a provision is required for separation costs is not considered as a critical judgement.

There are no other changes to critical judgements in applying accounting policies from the prior year.

The areas where assumptions and other sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows:

| Financial statement area | Critical accounting estimates and assumptions | Related note |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Intangible assets | Determination of the recoverable amount in relation to the impairment of goodwill. | Note 13 |
| Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss | Determination of the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities relating to the acquisition of Tritax. | Notes 34 and 36 |
| Defined benefit pension plans | Determination of principal UK pension plan assumptions for mortality, discount rate and inflation. | Note 31 |

All other critical accounting estimates and assumptions are the same as the prior year.

Further detail on critical accounting estimates and assumptions is provided in the relevant note.

# (a)(iv) Foreign currency translation
The consolidated financial statements are presented in million pounds Sterling.

The statements of financial position of Group entities, including associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method, that have a different functional currency than the Group's presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency at the year end exchange rate and their income statements and cash flows are translated at average exchange rates for the year. All resulting exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income and the foreign currency translation reserve in equity. On disposal of a Group entity the cumulative amount of any such exchange differences recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss.

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Gains and losses arising from such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the relevant line in the consolidated income statement.

Translation differences on non-monetary items, such as equity securities held at fair value through profit or loss, are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss within Net gains or losses on financial instruments and other income in the consolidated income statement. Translation differences on financial assets and liabilities held at amortised cost are included in the relevant line in the consolidated income statement.

# (a)(v) Going concern
The Group's business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and financial position, are set out in the Strategic report. This includes details on our liquidity and capital management and our viability statement in the Chief Financial Officer's overview section and our principal risks in the Risk management section including the impacts of the macroeconomic environment and global and regional geopolitical events on these principal risks. In addition, these financial statements include notes on the Group's subordinated liabilities (Note 30), management of its risks including market, credit and liquidity risk (Note 34), its contingent liabilities and commitments (Notes 38 and 39), and its capital structure and position (Note 42).

In preparing these financial statements on a going concern basis, the Directors have considered the following matters and have taken into account market uncertainty.
– The Group has cash and liquid resources of £1.8bn at 31 December 2023. In addition, the Company has a revolving credit facility of £400m as part of our contingency funding plans which is due to mature in 2026 and remains undrawn.
– The Group's indicative regulatory Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital surplus on an IFPR basis was £876m in excess of capital requirements at 31 December 2023. The regulatory CET1 capital surplus does not include the value of the Group's significant listed investment in Phoenix Group Holdings (Phoenix).
– The Group performs regular stress and scenario analysis as described in the Annual report and accounts 2023 Viability statement. The diverse range of management actions available meant the Group was able to withstand these extreme stresses.
– The Group's operational resilience processes have operated effectively during the period including the provision of services by key outsource providers.

Based on a review of the above factors the Directors are satisfied that the Group and Company have and will maintain sufficient resources to enable them to continue operating for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements. Accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. There were no material uncertainties relating to this going concern conclusion.

# Group financial statements continued

## (b) Basis of consolidation

The Group's financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries.

Subsidiaries are all entities (including investment vehicles) over which the Group has control. Control arises when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. For operating entities this generally accompanies a shareholding of 50% or more in the entity. For investment vehicles, including structured entities, the control assessment also considers the removal rights of other investors and whether the Group acts as principal or agent in assessing the link between power and variable returns. In determining whether the Group acts as principal, and therefore controls the entity, the removal rights of other investors and the magnitude of the variability associated with the returns are also taken into account. As a result, the Group often is considered to control investment vehicles in which its shareholding is less than 50%.

Where the Group is considered to control an investment vehicle, such as an open-ended investment company, a unit trust or a limited partnership, and it is therefore consolidated, the interests of parties other than the Group are assessed to determine whether they should be classified as liabilities or as non-controlling interests. The liabilities are recognised in the third party interest in consolidated funds line in the consolidated statement of financial position and any movements are recognised in the consolidated income statement. The financial liability is designated at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) as it is implicitly managed on a fair value basis as its value is directly linked to the market value of the underlying portfolio of assets. The interests of parties other than the Group in all other types of entities are recorded as non-controlling interests.

All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full.

The Group uses the acquisition method to account for acquisitions of businesses. At the acquisition date the assets and liabilities of the business acquired and any non-controlling interests are identified and initially measured at fair value on the consolidated statement of financial position.

When the Group acquires or disposes of a subsidiary, the profits and losses of the subsidiary are included from the date on which control was transferred to the Group until the date on which it ceases, with consistent accounting policies applied across all entities throughout.

A full list of the Company's subsidiaries is provided in Note 44.

(b) Acquisitions
(b)(i) Current year acquisitions of subsidiaries and other operations
Healthcare fund management capabilities of Tekla Capital Management
On 27 October 2023, abrdn Inc. purchased the healthcare fund management capabilities of Tekla Capital Management LLC (Tekla) through a purchase agreement. Tekla's investment team transferred to the Group as part of the agreement. The assets under management at the acquisition date were £2.3bn. The acquisition further strengthens abrdn's closed-end fund business and allows the Group to draw on Tekla's expertise in investing in the healthcare sector as it looks to build out its offering in this area.

At the acquisition date the consideration, net assets acquired and resulting goodwill were as follows:

| 27 October 2023 | £m |
|---|---|
| Cash consideration | 108 |
| Fair value of deferred and contingent consideration | 11 |
| Consideration | 119 |
| Fair value of net assets acquired | |
| Intangible assets | |
| Customer relationships and investment management contracts | 78 |
| Total assets | 78 |
| Total liabilities | – |
| Goodwill | 41 |

The fair value of the deferred and contingent consideration of £11m comprises:
- A guaranteed deferred consideration of £7m which is payable in equal instalments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the closing date.
- A contingent consideration with a fair value at acquisition of £4m. This has been calculated by reference to fee revenue and could range from US$nil to US$20m. It is measured on the first, second and third anniversaries of the closing date.

# Group financial statements continued

The seller has elected that a portion of deferred and contingent consideration will be payable to employees that transferred from Tekla to abrdn who are still employed by the Group at each anniversary date. Any consideration that was allocated to employees that have left revert to the seller so this arrangement has no impact on the total value of the consideration for the business acquired.

Intangible assets acquired in the business combination consist of investment management contract intangibles for the four NYSE listed funds which were managed by Tekla. Refer Note 13 for details of the key assumptions used in measuring the fair value of these intangibles at the acquisition date.

The goodwill arising on acquisition is mainly attributable to:
– The ability to develop and evolve the acquired product suite through the launch of other vehicles.
– The specialist knowledge in the equities and fixed income healthcare sector that the Tekla's investment team brings to the Group. This will generate market leading research and insights, which can be used by portfolio managers across our Investments segment.

The goodwill has been allocated to the abrdn Inc. cash generating unit. The goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

The amounts of revenue from contracts with customers and profit after tax contributed to the Group's consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2023 from the acquired Tekla business were £4m and £2m respectively. The profit contributed excludes amortisation of intangible assets acquired through business combinations. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2023, the Group's total revenue from contracts with customers for the year would have increased by £21m to £1,495m and the profit after tax would have increased by £13m to £25m.

Corporate transaction deal costs amounted to £2m of which were included within Restructuring and corporate transaction expenses in the year ended 31 December 2023.

## (b)(ii) Prior year acquisitions of subsidiaries
### Interactive Investor (ii)
On 27 May 2022, abrdn plc purchased 100% of the issued share capital of Antler Holdco Limited (Antler), the parent company for the Interactive Investor group of companies. The cash outflow at the completion of the acquisition was £1,496m, which comprised consideration of £1,485m and payments of £11m made by abrdn to fund the settlement of ii transaction liabilities as part of the transaction. The acquisition of ii provides abrdn with direct entry to the high-growth digitally enabled direct investing market, accessing new customer segments and capabilities. This allows abrdn customers to choose from a wide spectrum of wealth services, spanning self-directed investing through to high-touch financial advice, depending on their specific needs over their financial life.

On 1 September 2022, Antler made a dividend in specie to abrdn plc of its investment in Interactive Investor Limited which is now a direct subsidiary of abrdn plc. Refer Note A of the Company financial statements for further details.

## (c) Disposals
### (c)(i) Current year disposal of subsidiaries and other operations

## 2. Segmented analysis

The Group's reportable segments have been identified in accordance with the way in which the Group is structured and managed. IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires that the information presented in the financial statements is based on information provided to the 'Chief Operating Decision Maker' which for the Group is the executive leadership team.

### (a) Basis of segmentation
### (a)(i) Current reportable segments

**Investments**  
Our global asset management business which provides investment solutions for Institutional, Retail Wealth (previously named Wholesale) and Insurance Partners (previously named Insurance) clients.

**Adviser**  
Our UK financial adviser business which provides platform services to wealth managers and advisers.

**ii (previously named Personal)**  
ii, our direct investing platform, following its acquisition in 2022 (refer Note 1(b)(ii) for further details) and our financial planning business, abrdn Financial Planning and Advice. It also included the Group's discretionary fund management business until the completion of the sale of aCL on 1 September 2023. Refer Note 1 (c)(i) for further details.

These are all reported to the level of adjusted operating profit.

In addition to the Group's reportable segments above, the analysis of adjusted profit in Section b(i) below also reports the following:

**Other business operations and corporate costs (Other)**  
Other comprises of Finimize and our digital innovation group along with certain corporate costs.

### (a)(ii) Changes to basis of segmentation
As noted above, the Group now reports Other in addition to its reportable segments. Previously the Group only reported certain corporate costs in addition to its reportable segments (reported as Corporate/strategic). These costs are now reported within Other along with Finimize and our digital innovation group which were previously reported within Investments. Including Finimize and our digital innovation group within Other rather than the Investments reportable segment is considered to provide a clearer depiction of business structure and performance. Comparative amounts for the year ended 31 December 2022 have been prepared on a consistent basis.

In addition, from January 2023 and May 2023 respectively, threesixty and our Managed Portfolio Service (MPS) business have been reported within Adviser, both of which were previously reported within ii. Moving threesixty to Adviser brings together our businesses which provide services to wealth managers and advisers and prior to the completion of the sale of aCL, our MPS business, which was retained, moved from aCL to the Adviser business in order to maximise opportunities available through the Adviser distribution model. The impact of these changes on the Adviser and ii segments is not material and comparative amounts for the year ended 31 December 2022 have not been restated.

## 3. Net operating revenue

Net operating revenue represents revenue from contracts with customers after deduction of cost of sales.

Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised as services are provided i.e. as the performance obligation is satisfied. Performance fees and carried interest are only recognised once it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur in future periods. Where revenue is received in advance (front-end fees), this income is deferred and recognised as a deferred income liability (refer Note 32) and released to the Consolidated income statement over the period services are provided.

Where revenue received relates to performance obligations whose fulfilment involves another external party, for example fund accounting or custodian services, the Group assesses if it is acting as a principal with full responsibility for the performance obligation and control over its fulfilment or solely responsible for arranging for the third party to fulfil the performance obligation i.e. acting as an agent. Where the Group is acting as an agent, only its share of the revenue for the arrangement of the relevant service is recognised within revenue from contracts from customers, therefore the revenue is recognised net of the revenue passed on to the third party.

Commission and other fee expenses which relate directly to revenue are presented as cost of sales. These expenses include ongoing commission expenses payable to financial institutions, investment platform providers and financial advisers that distribute the Group's products which are generally based on an agreed percentage of AUM and are recognised in the income statement as the service is received. Other cost of sales also includes amounts payable to employees and others relating to carried interest and performance fee revenue.

# Investments

Through a number of its subsidiaries, the Group provides asset management services to its customers. This performance obligation is performed over time with the revenue recognised as the obligation is performed. The Group generally receives asset management fees based on the percentage of the assets under management. The percentage varies depending on the level and nature of assets under management. Asset management fees are either deducted from assets or invoiced. Deducted fees are generally calculated, recognised and collected on a daily basis. Other asset management fees are invoiced to the customer either monthly or quarterly with receivables recognised for unpaid invoices. The payment terms for invoiced revenue vary but are typically 30 days from receipt of invoice. Accrued income is recognised to account for income earned but not yet invoiced which is not dependent on any future performance.

There is also some use of performance fees and carried interest arrangements. Performance fees and carried interest are earned from some investment mandates when contractually agreed performance levels are exceeded within specified performance measurement periods. Performance fees and carried interest are only recognised once it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur in future periods. Given the unpredictability of future performance, the risk of a significant reversal occurring will typically only be considered low enough to make recognition appropriate upon the crystallisation event occurring.

## Adviser

Through a number of its subsidiaries, the Group offers customers access to fund platforms. The platforms give customers the ongoing functionality to manage and administer their investments. This performance obligation is performed over time with the revenue recognised as the obligation is performed. Customers pay a platform charge which is generally calculated as a percentage of their assets. The percentage varies depending on the level of assets on the specific platform. The main platform charges are calculated either daily or monthly and are collected and recognised monthly. The charges are collected directly from assets on the platform. There are no significant payment terms.

In addition, Adviser receives treasury income for providing management and administration of cash held in platform cash accounts. The performance obligation for cash management and administration is performed over time with the revenue recognised as the obligation is performed. The customer receives interest on their cash balances after deduction of a cash management administration charge which is generally calculated as a percentage of their cash held in relevant accounts. The percentage varies depending on the interest received from the banks used to provide the cash accounts. There are no significant payment terms.

## ii

Through a number of its subsidiaries, the Group also offers financial planning and discretionary fund management services. The sale of the Group's primary discretionary fund management business completed on 1 September 2023 (refer Note 1(c)(i) for further details) and the Managed Portfolio Service business has been reported within Adviser from May 2023 since its transfer from aCL.

Financial planning is either provided on a one-off basis or on an ongoing basis. The performance obligation for one-off advice is performed at a point in time with the revenue recognised when the advice is provided. The performance obligation for ongoing financial planning is performed over time with the revenue recognised as the obligation is performed. The Group generally receives ongoing financial planning fees based on the percentage of the assets under advice. One-off financial planning fees are invoiced to the customer following delivery of the advice. Ongoing financial planning fees are invoiced to the customer or a designated financial provider either monthly or quarterly. Receivables are recognised for unpaid invoices. The payment terms for invoiced revenue vary but are typically 30 days from receipt of invoice. Accrued income is recognised to account for income earned but not yet invoiced which is not dependent on any future performance. The performance obligation for discretionary fund management services is also performed over time with the revenue recognised as the obligation is performed. The Group generally receives discretionary fund management services fees based on the percentage of the assets under management. The percentage varies depending on the level and nature of assets under management. Discretionary fund management services fees are deducted from assets. Deducted fees are generally calculated, recognised and collected on a daily basis.

Through its subsidiary Interactive Investor Services Limited (ii), the Group offers a subscription-based trading and direct investing platform. The services that ii offers are provided on both a point in time and an over time basis.

Customers pay monthly account fees as part of ii's subscription model. Account fees are invoiced monthly and are payable immediately from the customer's account, with receivables recognised if there are insufficient funds available. The account fees cover the performance obligation to provide the customer with access to the platform and custody services. For certain subscription levels, the account fee also entitles the customer to receive trading credits which can be redeemed against future trades. For these subscription levels, the account fees also cover ii's performance obligation to perform these future trades. In accordance with IFRS 15, the account fees are allocated to the two performance obligations. Access to the platform and custody services is provided over time and the account fees revenue allocated to this performance obligation is recognised over the calendar month as the customer receives the benefit of these services. Trading credits need to be used by the customer within 31 days of the credit arising, therefore the revenue is recognised over the calendar month as a reasonable approximation of when the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time within the month.

# Group financial statements continued

In addition, ii performs additional trades and foreign exchange transactions for its customers. These are performed at a point in time with the revenue recognised at the trade date of the transaction. Trading fees for transactions not covered by trading credits are generally charged on a flat fee basis with larger international share trades charged based on a percentage of the trade value. These are added to the cost of purchasing shares or deducted from the proceeds from the sale of shares with receivables recognised for unsettled trades. For foreign exchange trades, ii receives a margin (varying depending on the size of the transaction) via a third party in the month following the transaction, with receivables recognised prior to the payment.

In addition, ii is entitled to receive treasury income in relation to its performance obligations to the customer. Treasury income is the interest earned on cash balances less the interest paid to customers based on the client money balances held with third party banks and by reference to the applicable interest rates. Treasury income is recognised on an over time basis with accrued income recognised for unpaid interest.

## (b) Cost of sales

# Group financial statements continued 

## 4. Net gains or losses on financial instruments and other income

Gains and losses resulting from changes in both market value and foreign exchange on investments classified as fair value through profit or loss are recognised in the consolidated income statement in the period in which they occur. The gains and losses include investment income received such as interest payments and dividend income. Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.

Interest income on financial instruments measured at amortised cost is separately recognised in the consolidated income statement using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate method allocates interest and other finance costs at a constant rate over the expected life of the financial instrument, or where appropriate a shorter period, by using as the interest rate the rate that exactly discounts the future cash receipts over the expected life to the net carrying value of the instrument.

Other income includes income related to vacant property and fair value movements in contingent consideration.

# 9. Taxation

The Group's tax expense comprises both current tax and deferred tax expense.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on taxable profit for the year and is calculated using tax rates and laws substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

A deferred tax asset represents a tax deduction that is expected to arise in a future period. It is only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the tax deduction will be capable of being offset against taxable profits and gains in future periods. A deferred tax liability represents taxes which will become payable in a future period as a result of a current or prior year transaction. Where local tax law allows, deferred tax assets and liabilities are netted off on the statement of financial position. The tax rates used to determine deferred tax are those enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date that are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset or liability are realised. Any tax consequences of distributions on other equity instruments are credited to the statement in which the profit distributed originally arose.

Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries and associates unless the timing of the reversal is in our control and it is expected that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The Group applies the exception to recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes.

Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in the consolidated income statement except when it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case it is credited or charged to other comprehensive income or directly to equity respectively.

The Group operates in a number of territories and during the normal course of business will be subject to audit or enquiry by local tax authorities. At any point in time the Group will also be engaged in commercial transactions the tax outcome of which may be uncertain due to their complexity or uncertain application of tax law. Tax provisions, therefore, are subjective by their nature and require management judgement based on the interpretation of legislation, management experience and professional advice. As such, this may result in the Group recognising provisions or disclosing contingent liabilities for uncertain tax positions. Management will provide for uncertain tax positions where they judge that it is probable there will be a future outflow of economic benefits from the Group to settle the obligation. Where a future outflow of economic benefits is judged as less than probable but more than remote, a contingent liability will be disclosed, where material. In assessing uncertain tax positions management considers each issue on its own merits using their judgement as to the estimate of the most likely outcome. When making estimates, management considers all available evidence. This may include forecasts of future profitability, the frequency and severity of any losses, and statutory carry forward and carry back provisions as well as management experience of tax attributes expiring without use. Where the final outcome differs from the amount provided this difference will impact the tax charge in future periods. Management re-assesses provisions at each reporting date based upon latest available information.

The standard UK Corporation Tax rate for the accounting period is 23.5%. The rate of UK Corporation Tax increased from 19% to 25% with effect from 1 April 2023.

The accounting for certain items in the consolidated income statement results in certain reconciling items in the table above, the values of which vary from year to year depending upon the underlying accounting values.

Details of significant reconciling items are as follows:
– Dividend income and fair value movements from our investments in Phoenix not being subject to tax.
– Movements in the fair value of our investment in HDFC Asset Management being tax effected at the Indian long-term capital gains tax rate, which is lower than the UK Corporation Tax rate.

| **Net deferred tax asset at 31 December** | 86 | 1 |

A deferred tax asset of £160m (2022: £170m) has been recognised by the Group in respect of losses of the parent company and various subsidiaries. The decrease in this deferred tax asset in 2023 reflects the utilisation of brought forward losses against taxable profits in the year.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the losses will be capable of being offset against taxable profits and gains in future periods. The value attributed to them takes into account the certainty or otherwise of their recoverability. Their recoverability is measured against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and anticipated taxable profits and gains based on business plans. The deferred tax asset recognised on losses relates to UK entities where there is currently no restriction on the period of time over which losses can be utilised. Recognition of this deferred tax asset requires that management must consider if it is more likely than not that this asset will be recoverable in future periods against future profits arising in the UK. In making this assessment management have considered future operating plans and forecast taxable profits and are satisfied that, following completion of transformation activities, forecast taxable profits will be sufficient to enable recovery of the UK tax losses. The financial forecasts considered were consistent with those used for the assessment of the Group's intangible assets (refer Note 13). Based upon the level of forecast taxable profits management do not consider there is significant risk of a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the deferred tax asset on UK tax losses within the next financial year. Management expect the deferred tax asset to be utilised over a period of between five and seven years.

Deferred tax liabilities relating to unrealised gains on investments at 31 December 2022 of £60m included £52m relating to the Group's investment in HDFC Asset Management. This investment was sold in 2023 (refer Note 11(a) for further details).

Deferred tax assets of £215m (2022: £212m) and liabilities of £129m (2022: £211m) are expected to be recovered or settled after more than 12 months.

## (d) Unrecognised deferred tax
Due to uncertainty regarding recoverability, deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the following:
– Cumulative losses carried forward of £91m (2022: £81m) in the UK and losses and other temporary differences of £360m (2022: £275m) in the US, losses of £10m in China (2022: £11m), losses of £10m in Japan (2022: £13m) and losses of £9m (2022: £19m) in other overseas jurisdictions.

Of these unrecognised deferred tax assets, certain losses have expiry dates as follows:
– US losses of £140m with expiry dates between 2035-2037 (2022: £79m).
– Other overseas losses of £21m with expiry dates between 2024-2033 (2022: £27m).

The following table provides an analysis of the losses with expiry dates for unrecognised deferred tax assets.

| | 2023 | 2022 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | £m | £m |
| Less than 1 year | 4 | 5 |
| Greater than or equal to 1 year and less than 5 years | 9 | 11 |
| Greater than or equal to 5 years and less than 10 years | 8 | 11 |
| Greater than 10 years | 140 | 79 |
| Total losses with expiry dates | 161 | 106 |

There is unrecognised deferred tax of £18m (2022: £nil) relating to temporary timing differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates and interests in joint arrangements.

## (e) Pillar Two taxes
The Group is within the scope of the OECD Pillar Two model rules. Pillar Two legislation was enacted in the UK, the jurisdiction in which abrdn plc is incorporated, and came into effect from 1 January 2024. The Group expects to be subject to top-up taxes in relation to its operations in Guernsey, where the statutory rate is below 15% and in Singapore where certain qualifying income is subject to a concessionary tax rate of 10% under the Singapore Financial Sector Incentive for Fund Managers. The Group also expects to be subject to top up taxes in the UK, in relation to its overseas joint ventures with a local effective tax rate below 15%. However, since the newly enacted tax legislation is only effective from 1 January 2024, there is no current tax impact for the year ended 31 December 2023.

As noted above, the Group has applied a temporary mandatory relief from deferred tax accounting for the impacts of the top-up tax and accounts for it as a current tax when it is incurred.

If the top-up tax had applied in 2023, then the associated profits relating to the Group's operations for the year ended 31 December 2023 that would be subject to it amount to £48.6m, with the average effective tax rate applicable to those profits during 2023 being 12 percent.

# 10. Earnings per share

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period excluding shares owned by the employee trusts that have not vested unconditionally to employees.

Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period to assume the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, such as share options granted to employees. Details of the share options and awards issued under the Group's employee plans are provided in Note 40.

Adjusted earnings per share is calculated on adjusted profit after tax attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Company.

Basic earnings per share was 0.1p (2022: 26.6p) and diluted earnings per share was 0.1p (2022: 26.6p) for the year ended 31 December 2023. The following table shows details of basic, diluted and adjusted earnings per share.

| Dilutive effect of share options and awards | 28 | 16 |
| Weighted average number of diluted ordinary shares outstanding | 1,930 | 2,110 |

In accordance with IAS 33, no share options and awards were treated as dilutive for the year ended 31 December 2022 due to the loss attributable to equity holders of abrdn plc in that period. This resulted in the diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share being calculated using the weighted average number of ordinary shares of 2,094 million.

## 11. Adjusted profit and adjusting items

Adjusted profit excludes the impact of the following items:
- Restructuring and corporate transaction expenses. Restructuring includes the impact of major regulatory change.
- Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and through the purchase of customer contracts.
- Profit or loss arising on the disposal of a subsidiary, joint venture or equity accounted associate.
- Change in fair value of/dividends from significant listed investments (see (a) below).
- Share of profit or loss from associates and joint ventures.
- Impairment loss/reversal of impairment loss recognised on investments in associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method.
- Fair value movements in contingent consideration.
- Items which are one-off and, due to their size or nature, are not indicative of the long-term operating performance of the Group.

The tax charge or credit allocated to adjusting items is based on the tax treatment of each adjusting item.

The operating, investing and financing cash flows presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows are for both adjusting and non-adjusting items.

### (a) Significant listed investments

During 2020 and 2021, the Group's investments in HDFC Life, Phoenix and HDFC Asset Management were reclassified from associates to equity securities and considered significant listed investments of the Group. Fair value movements on these investments are included as adjusting items, which is aligned with our treatment of gains on disposal for these holdings when they were classified as associates. Dividends from significant listed investments are also included as adjusting items, as these result in fair value movements.

During the year ended 31 December 2023:
- The Group's holding in HDFC Life reduced by 1.7% following the sale of 35,694,105 equity shares through a Bulk Sale on 31 May 2023 and the Group now has no remaining shareholding in HDFC Life. The total consideration net of taxes, expenses and related foreign exchange hedging was £198m.
- The Group's holding in HDFC Asset Management reduced by 10.2% following the sale of 21,778,305 equity shares through a Bulk Sale on 20 June 2023 and the Group now has no remaining shareholding in HDFC Asset Management. The total consideration net of taxes, expenses and related foreign exchange hedging was £337m.

Following the sales, the Group has one remaining significant listed investment, Phoenix.

### (b) Other

Other adjusting items for the year ended 31 December 2023 include:
- £36m for an insurance liability recovery in relation to the single process execution event in 2022. The £41m provision expense was included in other adjusting items for the year ended 31 December 2022. Refer Note 33.
- A £23m gain (2022: £35m gain) for net fair value movements in contingent consideration.
- £21m for provision expense relating to a potential tax liability. Refer Note 33.
- A £5m fair value loss (2022: £11m loss) on a financial instrument liability related to a prior period acquisition.
- A gain of £4m (2022: loss of £13m) in relation to market gains and losses on the investments held by the abrdn Financial Fairness Trust which is consolidated by the Group. The assets of the abrdn Financial Fairness Trust are restricted to be used for charitable purposes.

## 12. Dividends on ordinary shares

Dividends are distributions of profit to holders of abrdn plc's share capital and as a result are recognised as a deduction in equity. Final dividends are announced with the Annual report and accounts and are recognised when they have been approved by shareholders. Interim dividends are announced with the Half year results and are recognised when they are paid.

| | 2023 | | 2022 | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | Pence per share | £m¹ | Pence per share | £m |
| Prior year's final dividend paid | 7.30 | 142 | 7.30 | 154 |

| Total dividends paid on ordinary shares | | 279 | | 307 |
| | | | | |
| Current year final recommended dividend | 7.30 | 130 | 7.30 | 142 |

1. Estimated for current year final recommended dividend.

The final recommended dividend will be paid on 30 April 2024 to shareholders on the Company's register as at 15 March 2024, subject to approval at the 2024 Annual General Meeting. After the current year final recommended dividend, the total dividend in respect of the year ended 31 December 2023 is 14.60p (2022: 14.60p).

## 13. Intangible assets

Goodwill is created when the Group acquires a business and the consideration exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired. In determining the net assets acquired in business combinations, intangible assets are recognised where they are separable or arise from contractual or legal rights. Intangible assets acquired by the Group through business combinations consist mainly of customer relationships and investment management contracts, technology and brands. Any remaining value that cannot be identified as a separate intangible asset on acquisition forms part of goodwill.

In addition to intangible assets acquired through business combinations, the Group recognises as intangible assets software which has been developed internally and other purchased technology which is used in managing and executing our business. Costs to develop software internally are capitalised after the research phase and when it has been established that the project is technically feasible and the Group has both the intention and ability to use the completed asset.

Intangible assets are recognised at cost and amortisation is charged to the income statement over the length of time the Group expects to derive benefits from the asset. The allocation of the income statement charge to each reporting period is dependent on the expected pattern over which future benefits are expected to be derived. Where this pattern cannot be determined reliably the charge is allocated on a straight-line basis.

Goodwill is not charged to the income statement unless it becomes impaired.

The Group also recognises the cost of obtaining customer contracts (refer Note 3) as an intangible asset. These costs primarily relate to the cost of acquiring existing investment management contracts from other asset managers and commission costs for initial investors into new closed-end funds where these are borne by the Group. For the cost of obtaining customer contracts, the intangible asset is amortised on the same basis as the transfer to the customer of the services to which the intangible asset relates.

# FINANCIAL INFORMATION

At 31 December 2023, there was:
– £39m (2022: £nil) of goodwill attributable to the abrdn Inc. cash-generating unit (CGU) in the Investments segment in relation to the acquisition of the healthcare fund management capabilities of Tekla (refer Note 1(b)(i) for further details).
– £819m (2022: £819m) and £24m (2022: £60m) of goodwill attributable to the ii CGU and abrdn financial planning business CGU respectively in the ii segment (previously named Personal). At 31 December 2022 goodwill of £49m relating to the ii segment was classified as held for sale in relation to the sale of aCL which completed in 2023 (refer Note 1(c)(i) for further details).
– £25m (2022: £25m) of goodwill is attributable to an Adviser segment CGU. Prior to January 2023, this goodwill which relates to the acquisition of threesixty was attributable to a CGU in the ii segment.
– £5m (2022: £31m) of goodwill attributable to the Finimize CGU which is reported within Other business operations and corporate costs. Finimize was previously included within the Investments segment.

## Tekla investment management contract intangible assets
On acquisition of the healthcare fund management capabilities of Tekla, £78m of customer relationships and investment management contract intangibles were recognised. These assets primarily relate to investment management contracts with the four NYSE listed funds. The description of the individually material intangible assets including the estimated useful life at the acquisition date of 27 October 2023 were as follows:

| Investment management contract intangible asset | Description | Useful life at acquisition date | Fair value on acquisition date | Carrying value 2023 | Carrying value 2022 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tekla Healthcare Opportunities Fund | Investment management contract with Tekla Healthcare Opportunities Fund | 12.1 years | 28 | 26 | N/A |
| Tekla Healthcare Investors | Investment management contract with Tekla Healthcare Investors | 12.1 years | 25 | 23 | N/A |

The key assumptions, other than the useful life, in measuring the fair value of the investment contract intangible assets at acquisition date were as follows:
– Revenue growth – this assumption was based on past experience of growth for each fund in prior periods before reverting to a long term growth in line with inflation estimates. Management fee rates are assumed to stay in line with current rates.
– Operating margin – this assumption was based on the expected EBITDA of each acquired investment management contract.
– Discount rate – this assumption was based on a risk adjusted internal rate of return (IRR) of the transaction.

As with prior significant acquisitions, the Group made use of assistance from a third-party valuation specialist in determining the value of the customer intangibles.

As the investment management contracts relate to closed-end funds, the straight-line method of amortisation is considered appropriate for these intangibles. There has been no change to the useful lives and therefore the residual useful life of these investment management contract intangible assets is 11.9 years.

## ii intangible assets
On acquisition of ii, customer relationships, brand and technology and other intangibles of £421m, £16m and £32m respectively were recognised. Identification and valuation of intangible assets acquired in business combinations is a key judgement. The description of the individually material intangible asset including the estimated useful life at the acquisition date of 27 May 2022 was as follows:

| Customer relationship intangible asset | Description | Useful life at acquisition date | Fair value on acquisition date | Carrying value 2023 | Carrying value 2022 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Customer base | ii's customer base at the date of acquisition | 15 years | 421 | 340 | 390 |

The key assumptions in measuring the fair value of this intangible asset at acquisition date were as follows:
– Revenue per customer growth – comprises expected growth in account fees, treasury income and trading transactions revenue from ii business plans. Treasury income is the interest earned on cash balances less the interest paid to customers and was assumed to grow in line with assets under administration. Market interest rates were assumed to remain at or above 1%.
– Customer attrition – customer attrition represents the expected rate of existing customers leaving ii. This assumption was primarily based on historical attrition rates and was assumed to remain constant over time.
– Operating margin - this assumption was based on the current operating margins adjusted for marketing costs which are not attributable to the servicing of existing customers. Expected future operating margins are adjusted to take into account that increased treasury income does not result in higher costs.
– Discount rate - this assumption was based on a market participant weighted average cost of capital.

The above assumptions, and in particular the customer attrition assumption, were also used to determine the 15 year useful economic life at the acquisition date. There has been no change to the useful life and therefore the residual useful life of the customer relationships intangible asset is 13.4 years. The reducing balance method of amortisation is considered appropriate for this intangible, consistent with the attrition rate being constant over time.

The technology intangible asset relates to ii's internally generated technology which has been valued based on the replacement cost method. The brand intangible asset relates to the ii brand and has been valued based on applying an assumed royalty rate to revenue forecasts.

Following the valuation of the ii intangibles discussed above goodwill of £993m was recognised. The allocation of this goodwill to cash-generating units was a key judgement in 2022. The goodwill was allocated to cash-generating units based on expected earnings contribution, including in relation to revenue synergies, at the time of the transaction. We considered an earnings contribution method of allocation to be appropriate as earnings multiples are a primary valuation method for businesses such as ii. This resulted in the goodwill being primarily allocated to the ii cash-generating unit in the ii segment (£819m), with £132m and £42m allocated to the asset management group of cash-generating units in the Investments segment and a cash-generating unit in the ii segment respectively. As noted below, the £132m allocated to the asset management group of cash-generating units was subsequently impaired in 2022. The £42m allocated to a cash-generating unit in the ii segment was transferred to held for sale at 31 December 2022 and disposed of during 2023. Refer Note 21 for further details.

## Tritax investment management contract intangible assets
On acquisition of Tritax, £71m of customer relationships and investment management contracts intangibles were recognised. These assets primarily relate to Tritax's investment management contracts with Tritax Big Box REIT plc and Tritax Euro Box plc which are listed closed-end real estate funds. The description of the individually material intangible asset including the estimated useful life at the acquisition date of 1 April 2021 was as follows:

| Investment management contract intangible asset | Description | Useful life at acquisition date | Fair value on acquisition date £m | Carrying value 2023 £m | Carrying value 2022 £m |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tritax Big Box REIT plc | Investment management contract with Tritax Big Box REIT plc | 13 years | 50 | 40 | 43 |

The key assumptions, other than the useful life, in measuring the fair value of the investment contract intangible assets at acquisition date were as follows:
– Revenue growth – this assumption was based on the fund growth (from markets and investment performance) included in the Tritax business plan as adjusted for the impact of fund raisings which commenced prior to the acquisition date. Management fee rates are assumed to stay in line with current rates.
– Operating margin – this assumption was based on the current operating margins adjusted for expected cost synergies.
– Discount rate – this assumption was based on a market participant weighted average cost of capital.

As the investment management contracts relate to closed-end funds, the straight-line method of amortisation is considered appropriate for these intangibles. There has been no change to the useful lives and therefore the residual useful life of these investment management contract intangible assets is 10.25 years.

## abrdn Holdings Limited (aHL) intangibles
On the acquisition of aHL in 2017, we identified intangible assets in relation to customer relationships, brand and technology as being separable from goodwill. Identification and valuation of intangible assets acquired in business combinations is a key judgement.

The customer relationships acquired through aHL were grouped where the customer groups have similar economic characteristics and similar useful economic lives. This gave rise to three separate intangible assets which we termed Lloyds Banking Group, Open ended funds, and Segregated and similar.

In relation to the Open ended funds we considered that it was most appropriate to recognise an intangible asset relating to customer relationships between aHL and open ended fund customers, rather than an intangible asset relating to investment management agreements between aHL and aHL's open ended funds. Our judgement was that the value associated with the open ended fund assets under management was predominantly derived from the underlying customer relationships, taking into account that a significant proportion of these assets under management are from institutional clients.

The intangible asset for Lloyds Banking Group had a carrying value of £nil at the end of 2019. The description of the remaining two separate intangible assets including their estimated useful life at the acquisition date of 14 August 2017 was as follows:

| Customer relationship intangible asset | Description | Useful life at acquisition date | Fair value on acquisition date | Carrying value 2023 | Carrying value 2022 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Open ended funds | Separate vehicle group - open ended investment vehicles | 11 years | 223 | 30 | 45 |
| Segregated and similar | All other vehicle groups dominated by segregated mandates which represent 75% of this group | 12 years | 427 | 43 | 63 |

Measuring the fair value of intangible assets acquired in business combinations required further assumptions and judgements. Customer relationships were valued using discounted cash flow projections. The key assumptions in measuring the fair value of the customer relationships at the acquisition date were as follows:
- Net attrition - net attrition represents the expected rate of outflows of assets under management net of inflows from existing customers. This assumption was primarily based on recent experience.
- Market growth - a market growth adjustment was applied based on the asset class.
- Operating margin - this assumption was consistent with forecast margins and included the impact of synergies that would be expected by any market participant and impacted the customer relationship cash flows.
- Discount rate - this assumption was based on the internal rate of return (IRR) of the transaction and is consistent with a market participant discount rate.

The above assumptions, and in particular the net attrition assumption, were also used to determine the useful economic life at the acquisition date of each asset used for amortisation. The reducing balance method of amortisation is considered appropriate for these intangibles, consistent with the attrition pattern on customer relationships which means that the economic benefits delivered from the existing customer base will reduce disproportionately over time.

There has been no change to the useful lives of the Open ended funds and Segregated and similar customer relationship intangible assets. Therefore the residual useful life of the Open ended funds customer relationship intangible asset is 4.6 years and the residual life of the Segregated and similar customer relationship intangible asset is 5.6 years.

## Estimates and assumptions
The key estimates and assumptions in relation to intangible assets are:
– Determination of the recoverable amount of goodwill and customer intangibles.
– Determination of useful lives.

The determination of the recoverable amount of the interactive investor CGU is a key area of estimation uncertainty at 31 December 2023, and further details of assumptions and sensitivities are disclosed in this section.

## Determination of the recoverable amount of goodwill and customer intangibles
For all intangible assets including goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is an indication that the goodwill or intangible asset has become impaired. If any indication of impairment exists then the recoverable amount of the asset is determined. In addition, the recoverable amount for goodwill must be assessed annually.

The recoverable amounts are defined as the higher of fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD) and the value in use (VIU) where the value in use is based on the present value of future cash flows. Where the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount then the carrying value is written down to the recoverable amount.

In assessing value in use or FVLCD measured using a discounted cash flow approach, expected future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate for VIU or a post-tax discount rate for FVLCD. Judgement is required in assessing both the expected cash flows and an appropriate discount rate which is based on current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks associated with the asset.

## Goodwill
In 2023 impairments of goodwill of £62m (2022: £340m) have been recognised. The goodwill impairment for the year ended 31 December 2023 comprises £36m relating to the abrdn Financial Planning Limited (aFPL) CGU which is included in the ii segment and £26m relating to the Finimize CGU which is reported within Other business operations and corporate costs. The goodwill impairment for the year ended 31 December 2022 comprised £299m relating to the asset management group of CGUs and £41m relating to the Finimize CGU. Both impairments relate to assets which were included in the Investments segment. As noted above, the Finimize CGU is now reported within Other business operations and corporate costs.

The impairments are included within Impairment of intangibles acquired in business combinations and through the purchase of customer contracts in the consolidated income statement.

## aFPL
The aFPL CGU comprises the Group's financial planning business. A total impairment of £36m has been recognised in the year ended 31 December 2023 of which £23m was initially recognised at 30 June 2023. The impairments resulted from lower projected revenues as a result of lower markets and macroeconomic conditions and the impact of business restructuring. Following the impairment, the goodwill allocated to the aFPL CGU was £24m (2022: £60m).

The recoverable amount of the aFPL CGU which was its FVLCD at 31 December 2023 was £45m. This was also the carrying value of the CGU at 31 December 2023. The FVLCD considered a number of valuation approaches, with the primary approach being a multiples approach based on price to revenue and price to assets under advice (AUAdv). Multiples were based on trading multiples for aFPL's peer companies, adjusted to take into account profitability where appropriate, and were benchmarked against recent transactions. Revenue was based on actual 2023 and forecast 2024 revenue and AUAdv were based on forecast 2024 AUAdv. The expected cost of disposal was based on past experience of previous transactions. This is a level 3 measurement as they are measured using inputs which are not based on observable market data.

As the carrying value of the CGU is equal to the recoverable amount any downside sensitivity will lead to a further future impairment loss. A 20% reduction in recurring revenue and AUAdv would result in a further impairment of £11m. A 20% reduction in multiples would result in a further impairment of £11m.

No impairment of this goodwill was recognised in 2022. At 31 December 2022, the carrying value of this CGU was equal to the recoverable amount. As above, the recoverable amount was based on FVLCD which similarly considered a number of valuation approaches, with the primary approach being a multiples approach based on price to revenue and price to AUAdv.

# Finimize

The Finimize CGU comprises the Finimize business. A total impairment of £26m has been recognised in the year ended 31 December 2023 of which £14m was initially recognised at 30 June 2023. The impairments resulted from lower short-term projected growth following a strategic shift that prioritises profitability over revenue growth in the pursuit of a sustainable, resilient if lower growing business in the short term and broader market conditions. Following the impairment, the goodwill allocated to the Finimize CGU was £5m (2022: £31m).

The recoverable amount of the Finimize CGU at 31 December 2023 was £10m which was based on FVLCD. This was also the carrying value of the CGU at 31 December 2023. The FVLCD considered a number of valuation approaches, with the primary approach being a revenue multiple approach. The key assumptions used in determining the revenue multiple valuation were future revenue projections, which were based on management forecasts and assumed a continued level of revenue growth, and market multiples. Market multiples were based on broadly comparable listed companies, with appropriate discounts applied to take into account profitability, track record, revenue growth potential, and net premiums for control. This is a level 3 measurement as they are measured using inputs which are not based on observable market data.

The residual goodwill allocated to the Finimize CGU is not significant in comparison to the total carrying amount of goodwill.

The goodwill allocated to the Finimize CGU was also impaired in 2022 by £41m. The recoverable amount of the Finimize CGU at 31 December 2022 was £35m which was based on FVLCD. As above, the FVLCD considered a number of valuation approaches, with the primary approach being a revenue multiple approach.

## Asset management

At 31 December 2023, there is no goodwill allocated to the asset management group of CGUs (2022: none). The goodwill of £41m in relation to the acquisition of healthcare fund management capabilities of Tekla has been allocated to the abrdn Inc. CGU (see below).

As noted above, an impairment of £299m was recognised in 2022 in relation to goodwill allocated to the asset management group of CGUs. The asset management group of CGUs comprised the Investments segment (excluding Finimize) which was the lowest group of CGUs to which the asset management goodwill had been allocated at this time. The goodwill prior to impairment of £299m included additions in 2022 of £132m allocated to the asset management group of CGUs for revenue synergies in our Investments segment in relation to the acquisition of ii. The recoverable amount of this group of CGUs at 31 December 2022 was £1,532m which was based on FVLCD. The FVLCD considered a number of valuation approaches, with the primary approach being a discounted cash flow approach.

## interactive investor

Goodwill of £819m (2022: £819m) is allocated to the interactive investor CGU which comprises the interactive investor business in the ii segment. The recoverable amount of this CGU was determined based on FVLCD. The FVLCD was based on an earnings multiple approach. This is a level 3 measurement as it is measured using inputs which are not based on observable market data.

The key assumptions used in determining the earnings multiple valuation were future post tax adjusted earnings, which were based on management's business plan projections and reflected past experience and market price to earnings multiples, which were based on multiples of a peer group of comparable listed direct-to-consumer investment platform providers.

## Sensitivities of key assumptions

The business plan projections used to determine the future earnings are based on macroeconomic forecasts including interest rates and inflation, and forecast levels of client activity, market pricing, the percentage of client funds held in cash and expenses. The projections are therefore sensitive to these assumptions. Given current macroeconomic uncertainties a 20% reduction in forecast earnings has been provided as a sensitivity.

The market price to earnings multiple used in the valuation is 16x based on multiples of a peer group of comparable listed direct-to-consumer investment platform providers. This assumption is sensitive to general equity market fluctuations and to market views on UK direct-to-consumer investment platform companies. Taking into account historic equity market fluctuations a 25% sensitivity to an earnings multiple has been provided as a sensitivity.

The recoverable amount at 31 December 2023 exceeds the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit by £398m. The impact of sensitivities to a single variable and the change required to reduce headroom to zero are shown in the tables below.

## Reduction in headroom for illustrative sensitivities
|   | £m |
|---|---|
| 20% reduction in forecast post tax adjusted earnings | (346) |
| 25% reduction in market multiple | (433) |

## Change required to reduce headroom to zero
|   | % |
|---|---|
| Change in forecast post tax adjusted earnings | (24) |
| Reduction in market multiple | (24) |

We consider the 24% reduction in market multiple assumption to 12x to reduce the headroom to zero to be a reasonably possible change.

## Other goodwill
Goodwill of £39m (2022: £nil) is attributable to the abrdn Inc. CGU in the Investments segment. As noted above, this relates to the acquisition of healthcare fund management capabilities of Tekla. Refer Note 1(b)(i) for further details. No impairment of this goodwill has been identified since acquisition.

Goodwill of £25m (2022: £25m) is attributable to an Adviser segment CGU (included in an ii segment CGU in 2022).

These goodwill balances are not significant in comparison to the total carrying amount of goodwill.

## Customer relationship and investment management contract intangibles
An impairment of customer relationship and investment management contract intangibles of £1m has been recognised in 2023.

In 2022, an impairment of £28m was recognised in relation to customer relationship and investment management contract intangibles. The impairment was included within Impairment of intangibles acquired in business combinations and through the purchase of customer contracts in the consolidated income statement. The impairment related to the Phoenix Life business intangible asset which was recognised on the acquisition of Ignis Asset Management in 2014, and was part of the Investments segment. The recoverable of this intangible asset at 31 December 2022 was £nil which was based on its FVLCD, based on a discounted cash flow approach based on expected future cashflows for the Phoenix Life business.

## Determination of useful lives
The determination of useful lives requires judgement in respect of the length of time that the Group expects to derive benefits from the asset and considers for example expected duration of customer relationships and when technology is expected to become obsolete for technology based assets. The amortisation period and method for each of the Group's intangible asset categories is as follows:
- Customer relationships acquired through business combinations – generally between 7 and 15 years, generally reducing balance method.
- Investment management contracts acquired through business combinations – between 10 and 17 years, straight-line.
- Brand acquired through business combinations – between 2 and 5 years, straight-line.
- Technology and other intangibles acquired through business combinations – between 1 and 6 years, straight-line.
- Internally developed software – between 2 and 6 years. Amortisation is on a straight-line basis and commences once the asset is available for use.
- Purchased software – between 2 and 6 years, straight-line.
- Costs of obtaining customer contracts – between 3 and 12 years, generally reducing balance method.

## Internally developed software
There was an impairment of internally developed software of £2m in 2023 (2022: £nil).

# 14. Investments in associates and joint ventures

Associates are entities where the Group can significantly influence decisions made relating to the financial and operating policies of the entity but does not control the entity. For entities where voting rights exist, significant influence is presumed where the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Where the Group holds less than 20% of voting rights, consideration is given to other indicators and entities are classified as associates where it is judged that these other indicators result in significant influence.

Joint ventures are strategic investments where the Group has agreed to share control of an entity's financial and operating policies through a shareholders' agreement and decisions can only be taken with unanimous consent.

Associates, other than those accounted for at fair value through profit or loss, and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method from the date that significant influence or shared control, respectively, commences until the date this ceases with consistent accounting policies applied throughout.

Under the equity method, investments in associates and joint ventures are initially recognised at cost. When an interest is acquired at fair value from a third party, the value of the Group's share of the investee's identifiable assets and liabilities is determined applying the same valuation criteria as for a business combination at the acquisition date. This is compared to the cost of the investment in the investee. Where cost is higher the difference is identified as goodwill and the investee is initially recognised at cost which includes this component of goodwill. Where cost is lower a bargain purchase has arisen and the investee is initially recognised at the Group's share of the investee's identifiable assets and liabilities unless the recoverable amount for the purpose of assessing impairment is lower, in which case the investee is initially recognised at the recoverable amount.

Subsequently the carrying value is adjusted for the Group's share of post-acquisition profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate or joint venture, which are recognised in the consolidated income statement and other comprehensive income respectively. The Group's share of post-acquisition profit or loss includes amortisation charges based on the valuation exercise at acquisition. The carrying value is also adjusted for any impairment losses.

On partial disposal of an associate, a gain or loss is recognised based on the difference between the proceeds received and the equity accounted value of the portion disposed of. Indicators of significant influence are reassessed based on the remaining voting rights. Where significant influence is judged to have been lost, the investment in associate is reclassified to interests in equity securities and pooled investment funds measured at fair value. If an entity is reclassified, the difference between the fair value and the remaining equity accounted value is accounted for as a reclassification gain or loss on disposal.

Where the Group has an investment in an associate, a portion of which is held by, or is held indirectly through, a mutual fund, unit trust or similar entity, including investment-linked insurance funds, that portion of the investment is measured at FVTPL. In general, investment vehicles which are not subsidiaries are considered to be associates where the Group holds more than 20% of the voting rights.

The level of future dividend payments and other transfers of funds to the Group from associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method could be restricted by the regulatory solvency and capital requirements of the associate or joint venture, certain local laws or foreign currency transaction restrictions.

During the year ended 31 December 2023, the Group increased its interest in Archax from 9.8% to 11% following a further £2m investment. The classification of Archax as an associate reflects the Group's additional rights under Archax's articles of association as a large external investor. There are no indicators of impairment in relation to Archax at 31 December 2023.

During the year ended 31 December 2022, the Group recognised an impairment of £9m in relation to its interest in Tenet which reduced its value to £nil. There has been no further investment into Tenet in 2023 and no further impairment has been recognised.

# HASL
The Group has a 50% share in HASL, one of China's leading life insurance companies offering life and health insurance products. HASL is an investment which gives the Group access to one of the world's largest markets. The table below provides summarised financial information for HASL, the joint venture which is considered to be material to the Group. HASL's year-end date is 31 December, however, HASL is not required to adopt IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 for its local reporting until 2026. Consequently, HASL has provided additional financial information on an IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 basis for the purposes of the preparation of the Group's consolidated financial statements.

For further details of HASL's implementation of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9, refer Basis of Preparation.

2. As a liquidity presentation is used by insurance companies when presenting their statement of financial position, an analysis of total assets and total liabilities between current and non-current has not been provided for HASL.

In relation to HASL, there are no indicators that the recoverable amount of the Group's investment in HASL is less than the Group's share of net assets.

## Virgin Money UTM
The carrying value of joint ventures accounted for using the equity method for Other at 31 December 2022 primarily related to the Group's interest in Virgin Money UTM. As detailed in Note 43, the agreed sale of the Group's interest in Virgin Money UTM to its joint venture partner, Clydesdale Bank, has been announced. At 31 December 2023, a sale was considered as highly probable and the Group's interest in Virgin Money UTM was transferred to held for sale at this date at a carrying value of £9m (refer Note 21).

The sale was also considered as an indicator that there was a small reversal of the £45m impairment of the interest that was recognised in 2020. The carrying value prior to reversal of impairment was £7m. The recoverable amount of Virgin Money UTM prior to transfer was £20m which was based on FVLCD and determined based on the agreed sale price. However, as the Group had recognised £11m for its share of Virgin Money UTM's losses since the previous impairment, the reversal of impairment recognised prior to the transfer was limited to £2m. The reversal of impairment is included in Reversal of impairment/(impairment) of interests in associates and joint ventures in the consolidated income statement. The interest in Virgin Money UTM does not form part of the Group's reportable segments.

## (d) Investments in associates measured at FVTPL
The aggregate fair value of associates accounted for at FVTPL included in equity securities and interests in pooled investment funds (refer Note 17) at 31 December 2023 is £10m (2022: £46m) none of which are considered individually material to the Group.

## 15. Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment consists primarily of property owned and occupied by the Group and the computer equipment used to carry out the Group's business along with right-of-use assets for leased property and equipment.

**Owner occupied property:** Owner occupied property is initially recognised at cost and subsequently revalued to fair value at each reporting date. Depreciation, being the difference between the carrying amount and the residual value of each significant part of a building, is charged to the consolidated income statement over its useful life. The useful life of each significant part of a building is estimated as being between 30 and 50 years. A revaluation surplus is recognised in other comprehensive income unless it reverses a revaluation deficit which has been recognised in the consolidated income statement.

**Equipment:** Equipment is initially recognised at cost and subsequently measured at cost less depreciation. Depreciation is charged to the income statement over 2 to 15 years depending on the length of time the Group expects to derive benefit from the asset.

**Right-of-use asset:** Refer Note 16 below for the accounting policies for right-of-use assets.

Included in property right-of-use assets, are right-of-use assets that meet the definition of investment property. Their carrying amount at 31 December 2023 is £31m (2022: £14m). This comprises a gross carrying value of £134m (2022: £49m) and accumulated depreciation and impairment of £103m (2022: £35m). Rental income received and direct operating expenses incurred to generate that rental income in the year to 31 December 2023 were £3m (2022: £3m) and £2m (2022: £3m) respectively. In addition, there were direct expenses of £1m (2022: £1m) in relation to investment properties not currently generating income.

The movements during the period of the carrying value of the Group's investment property is analysed below.

| | 2023 £m | 2022 £m |

| At start of period | 14 | 21 |
| Transfers to investment property | 63 | - |
| Transfers from investment property | (3) | - |

| Impairments | (39) | (3) |
| Reversal of impairment | 3 | - |
| Disposals and adjustments | - | (1) |
| At end of period | 31 | 14 |

The transfers to investment property relate to a number of properties in the UK and the US that will no longer be used operationally by the Group. The right-of-use assets were assessed for impairment at the point of transfer. Impairments of £39m have been recognised in the year ended 31 December 2023 in relation to these properties and one other property in the UK previously transferred to investment property. The right-of-use assets are related to the Investments segment (£27m impairment) ii segment (£1m impairment) and Other business operations and corporate costs (£11m impairment).

The recoverable amount for the properties in the UK, which was based on value in use, was £27m using a pre-tax discount rate of 6%. The recoverable amount for the properties in the US, which was based on value in use, was £4m using a pre-tax discount rate of 7%. The cash flows were based on the rental income expected to be received under subleases during the term of the lease and the direct expenses expected to be incurred in managing the leased property, discounted using a discount rate that reflects the risks inherent in the cash flow estimates. The assessment of the cash flows takes into consideration climate related factors such as the energy efficiency of the buildings. It is not based on valuations by an independent valuer.

The transfers from investment property relate to a property in the UK which was not being used operationally but following the review of properties in the UK is being brought back into operational use. The right-of-use asset was assessed for reversal of impairment at the point of transfer. The Group has recognised a reversal of impairment of £3m in the year ended 31 December 2023 in relation to this property. The recoverable amount for this property was its carrying value at 30 June 2023 if it had not previously been impaired. The right-of-use asset is also related to the Investments segment.

The fair value of investment property included within right-of-use assets at 31 December 2023 is £36m (2022: £14m). The valuation technique used to determine the fair value considers the rental income expected to be received under subleases during the term of the lease and the direct expenses expected to be incurred in managing the leased property, discounted using a discount rate that reflects the risks inherent in the cash flow estimates. It is not based on valuations by an independent valuer. This is a Level 3 valuation technique as defined in Note 36.

If owner occupied property was measured using the cost model, the historical cost before impairment would be £1m (2022: £1m). As the expected residual value of owner occupied property is in line with the current fair value, no depreciation is currently charged.

Further details on the leases under which the Group's right-of-use assets are recognised are provided in Note 16 below.

## 16. Leases

A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. In 2019, on adoption of IFRS 16 the Group used the practical expedient permitted to apply the new standard at transition solely to leases previously identified in accordance with IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses and are presented in property, plant and equipment (refer Note 15). The Group does not revalue its right-of-use assets. This applies to all right-of-use assets, including those that are assessed as meeting the definition of investment property. The cost comprises the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability plus any initial direct costs and expected restoration costs not relating to wear and tear. Costs relating to wear and tear are expensed over the term of the lease. Depreciation is charged on right-of-use assets on a straight-line basis from the lease commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The Group assesses right-of-use assets for impairment when such indicators exist, and where required, reduces the value of the right-of-use asset accordingly.

The related lease liability (included in other financial liabilities – refer Note 32) is calculated as the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments are discounted using the rate implicit within the lease where readily available or the Group's incremental borrowing rate where the implicit rate is not readily available. Interest is calculated on the liability using the discount rate and is charged to the consolidated income statement under finance costs.

In determining the value of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, the Group considers whether any leases contain lease extensions or termination options that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise.

Where a leased property has been sublet, the Group assesses whether the sublease has transferred substantially all the risk and rewards of the right-of-use asset to the lessee under the sublease. Where this is the case, the right-of-use asset is derecognised and a net investment in finance leases (included in Receivables and other financial assets – refer Note 19) is recognised, calculated as the present value of the future lease payments receivable under the sublease. Where a property is only partially sublet, only the portion of the right-of-use asset relating to the sublet part of the property is derecognised and recognised as a net investment in finance leases.

Any difference between the initial value of the net investment in finance leases and the right-of-use asset derecognised is recognised in the consolidated income statement (within other income or expenses). Interest is calculated on the net investment in finance lease using the discount rate and is recognised in the consolidated income statement as interest income.

Where the sublease does not transfer substantially all the risk and rewards of the right-of-use assets to the lessee under the sublease, the Group continues to recognise the right-of-use asset. The sublease is accounted for as an operating lease with the lease payments received recognised as property rental income in other income in the consolidated income statement. Lease incentives granted are recognised as an integral part of the property rental income and are spread over the term of the lease.

The Group does not recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases (less than one year from inception) and leases where the underlying asset is of low value.

# (a) Leases where the Group is lessee

The Group leases various offices and equipment used to carry out its business. Leases are generally for fixed periods but may be subject to extensions or early termination clauses. The remaining periods for current leases range from less than 1 year to 15 years (2022: less than 1 year to 16 years). A number of leases which are due to end in 2031 contain options that would allow the Group to extend the lease term. The Group reviews its property use on an ongoing basis and these extensions have not been included in the right-of-use asset or lease liability calculations. The Group has committed to one lease at 31 December 2023 which had not commenced at this date. The expected lease liability for these leases is not significant to the Group.

The Group has recognised the following assets and liabilities in relation to these leases where the Group is a lessee:

| | 2023<br>£m | 2022<br>£m |
|---|---|---|
| Right-of-use assets: | | |
| Property | 115 | 144 |
| Equipment | 1 | 1 |
| Total right-of-use assets | 116 | 145 |
| | | |
| Lease liabilities | (223) | (224) |

Details of the movements in the Group's right-of-use assets including additions and depreciation are included in Note 15.

The interest on lease liabilities is as follows:

| | 2023<br>£m | 2022<br>£m |
|---|---|---|
| Interest on lease liabilities | 6 | 6 |

The total cash outflow for lease liabilities recognised in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended 31 December 2023 was £30m (2022: £52m). Refer Note 37(f) for further details.

The following table provides a maturity analysis of the contractual undiscounted cash flows for the lease liabilities.

| | 2023<br>£m | 2022<br>£m |
|---|---|---|
| Less than 1 year | 26 | 29 |
| Greater than or equal to 1 year and less than 2 years | 25 | 24 |
| Greater than or equal to 2 years and less than 3 years | 26 | 23 |
| Greater than or equal to 3 years and less than 4 years | 26 | 24 |
| Greater than or equal to 4 years and less than 5 years | 25 | 23 |
| Greater than or equal to 5 years and less than 10 years | 91 | 99 |
| Greater than or equal to 10 years and less than 15 years | 32 | 38 |
| Greater than or equal to 15 years | – | 4 |
| Total undiscounted lease liabilities | 251 | 264 |

The Group does not recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases and leases where the underlying asset is of low value. The expenses for these leases for the year ended 31 December 2023 were £1m (2022: £3m). The Group has no lease commitments for short-term leases at 31 December 2023 (2022: none).

# (b) Leases where the Group is lessor (subleases)

Where the Group no longer requires a leased property, the property may be sublet to a third party. The sublease may be for the full remaining term of the Group's lease or only part of the remaining term.

At 31 December 2023, the Group had a net investment in finance leases asset of £31m (2022: £29m) for subleases which had transferred substantially all the risk and rewards of the right-of-use assets to the lessee under the sublease. All other subleases are accounted for as operating leases.

(b)(i) Finance leases
During the year ended 31 December 2023, the Group received finance income on the net investment in finance leases asset of less than £1m (2022: less than £1m). The Group recorded an initial gain of £6m in relation to new subleases entered into during the year ended 31 December 2023 (2022: £1m). The following table provides a maturity analysis of the future contractual undiscounted cash flows for the net investment in finance leases and a reconciliation to the net investment in finance leases asset.

# 17. Financial assets

Financial assets are initially recognised at their fair value. Subsequently all equity securities and interests in pooled investment funds and derivative instruments are measured at fair value. All equity securities and interests in pooled investment funds are classified as FVTPL on a mandatory basis. Changes in their fair value are recognised in Net gains or losses on financial instruments and other income in the consolidated income statement. The classification of derivatives and the accounting treatment of derivatives designated as a hedging instrument are set out in Note 18.

The subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on whether their cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest and the nature of the business model they are held in as follows:

| SPPI¹ test satisfied? | Business model | Classification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Yes | A: Objective is to hold to collect contractual cash flows | Amortised cost² |
| Yes | B: Objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling | Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)² |
| Yes | C: Objective is neither A nor B | FVTPL |
| No | N/A | FVTPL |

1. Solely payments of principal and interest.
2. May be classified as FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency (sometimes referred to as an 'accounting mismatch') that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognising the gains and losses on them on different bases.

The Group has no direct holding in debt instruments that are managed within a business model whose objective is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling and therefore there are no debt instruments classified as FVOCI. The Group's Chinese joint venture, HASL, does hold debt securities classified as FVOCI. Refer Basis of Preparation for further details. Debt instruments classified as FVTPL are classified as such due to the business model they are managed under, predominantly being held in consolidated investment vehicles.

The methods and assumptions used to determine fair value of financial assets at FVTPL are discussed in Note 36.

Amortised cost is calculated, and related interest is credited to the consolidated income statement, using the effective interest method. Impairment is determined using an expected credit loss impairment model which is applied to all financial assets measured at amortised cost. Financial assets measured at amortised cost attract a loss allowance equal to either:
– 12 month expected credit losses (losses resulting from possible default within the next 12 months).
– Lifetime expected credit losses (losses resulting from possible defaults over the remaining life of the financial asset).

Financial assets attract a 12 month ECL allowance unless the asset has suffered a significant deterioration in credit quality or the simplified approach for calculation of ECL has been applied. As permitted under IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, the Group has applied the simplified approach to calculate the ECL allowance for trade receivables and contract assets recognised under IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and lease receivables recognised under IFRS 16 Leases. Under the simplified approach the ECL is always equal to the lifetime expected credit loss.

The table below sets out an analysis of financial assets excluding those assets backing unit linked liabilities which are set out in Note 23.

|  | | At fair value through profit or loss¹ | | Cash flow hedge² | | At amortised cost | | Total | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | Notes | 2023 £m | 2022 £m | 2023 £m | 2022 £m | 2023 £m | 2022 £m | 2023 £m | 2022 £m |

| Total |  | 1,892 | 2,663 | 41 | 85 | 2,381 | 2,231 | 4,314 | 4,979 |

1. All financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss have been classified at FVTPL on a mandatory basis. The Group has not designated any financial assets as FVTPL.
2. Changes in fair value are recognised in the Cash Flow Hedges Reserve (refer Note 27) but may be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss.

# Group financial statements continued

The amount of debt securities expected to be recovered or settled after more than 12 months is £8m (2022: £2m). Due to the nature of equity securities and interests in pooled investment funds, there is no fixed term associated with these securities. The amount of equity securities and interests in pooled investment funds expected to be recovered or settled after more than 12 months is £1,139m (2022: £669m).

Included in Proceeds from sale or redemption of financial investments of £1,029m (2022: £1,633m) within the consolidated statement of cash flows are £576m (2022: £789m) in relation to sales of significant listed investments. Refer Note 11 for further details of the sales in 2023.

## 18. Derivative financial instruments

A derivative is a financial instrument that is typically used to manage risk and whose value moves in response to an underlying variable such as interest or foreign exchange rates. The Group uses derivative financial instruments in order to match subordinated debt liabilities and to reduce the risk from potential movements in foreign exchange rates on seed capital and co-investments and potential movements in market rates on seed capital. Certain consolidated investment vehicles may also use derivatives to take and alter market exposure, with the objective of enhancing performance and controlling risk.

Management determines the classification of derivatives at initial recognition. All derivative instruments are classified as at FVTPL except those designated as part of a cash flow hedge or net investment hedge. Derivatives at FVTPL are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated income statement.

On adoption of IFRS 9 Financial instruments in 2019, the Group has elected to continue applying the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39. The accounting treatment below applies to derivatives designated as part of a hedging relationship.

Using derivatives to manage a particular exposure is referred to as hedging. For a derivative to be considered as part of a hedging relationship its purpose must be formally documented at inception. In addition, the effectiveness of the hedge must be initially high and be able to be reliably measured on a regular basis. Derivatives used to hedge variability in future cash flows such as coupons payable on subordinated liabilities or revenue receivable in a foreign currency are designated as cash flow hedges, while derivatives used to hedge currency risk on investments in foreign operations are designated as net investment hedges.

Where a derivative qualifies as a cash flow or net investment hedge, hedge accounting is applied. The effective part of any gain or loss resulting from the change in fair value is recognised in other comprehensive income, and in the cash flow or net investment hedge reserve in equity, while any ineffective part is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement. If a derivative ceases to meet the relevant hedging criteria, hedge accounting is discontinued.

For cash flow hedges, the amount recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve is transferred to the consolidated income statement (recycled) in the same period or periods during which the hedged item affects profit or loss and is transferred immediately if the cash flow is no longer expected to occur. For net investment hedges, the amount recognised in the net investment hedge reserve is transferred to the consolidated income statement on disposal of the investment.

|  | Notes | Contract amount £m | Fair value assets £m | Fair value liabilities £m | Contract amount £m | Fair value assets £m | Fair value liabilities £m |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  | **2023** | | | **2022** | | |
| Cash flow hedges | 17,29 | 588 | 41 | - | 623 | 85 | - |

| Total derivative financial instruments |  | 1,218 | 43 | 9 | 1,519 | 105 | 3 |

Derivative assets of £41m (2022: £85m) are expected to be recovered after more than 12 months. There are no derivative liabilities (2022: none) expected to be settled after more than 12 months.

## (a) Hedging strategy
The Group generally does not hedge the currency exposure relating to revenue and expenditure, nor does it hedge translation of overseas profits in the income statement. Where appropriate, the Group may use derivative contracts to reduce or eliminate currency risk arising from individual transactions or seed capital and co-investment activity.

# (a)(i) Cash flow hedges
On 18 October 2017, the Group issued subordinated notes with a principal amount of US$750m. In order to manage its foreign exchange risk relating to the principal and coupons payable on these notes the Group entered into a cross-currency swap which is designated as a cash flow hedge. The cash flow hedge was fully effective during the year. The cross-currency swap has the effect of swapping the 4.25% US Dollar fixed rate subordinated notes into 3.2% Sterling fixed rate subordinated notes with a principal amount of £569m. The cross-currency swap has a fair value asset position of £41m (2022: £85m asset). During the year ended 31 December 2023 fair value losses of £40m (2022: gains of £85m) were recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to the cross-currency swap. Losses of £35m (2022: gains of £70m) were transferred from other comprehensive income to Net gains or losses on financial instruments and other income in the consolidated income statement in relation to the cross-currency swap during the year. In addition, forward points of £6m (2022: £6m) and gains of £1m (2022: gains of £2m) were transferred from other comprehensive income to Finance costs in the consolidated income statement.

# (a)(ii) FVTPL
Derivative financial instruments classified as FVTPL include those that the Group holds as economic hedges of financial instruments that are measured at fair value. FVTPL derivative financial instruments are also held by the Group to match contractual liabilities that are measured at fair value or to achieve efficient portfolio management in respect of instruments measured at fair value.

# 21. Assets and liabilities held for sale

Assets and liabilities held for sale are presented separately in the consolidated statement of financial position and consist of operations and individual non-current assets whose carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction (expected within one year) and not through continuing use.

Operations held for sale, being disposal groups, and investments in associates accounted for using the equity method are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and their fair value less disposal costs. No depreciation or amortisation is charged on assets in a disposal group once it has been classified as held for sale.

Operations held for sale include newly established investment vehicles which the Group has seeded but is actively seeking to divest from. For these investment funds, which do not have significant liabilities or non-financial assets, financial assets continue to be measured based on the accounting policies that applied before they were classified as held for sale. The Group classifies seeded operations as held for sale where the intention is to dispose of the investment vehicle in a single transaction. Where disposal of a seeded investment vehicle will be in more than one tranche the operations are not classified as held for sale in the consolidated statement of financial position.

Certain amounts seeded into funds are classified as interests in pooled investment funds. Investment property and owner occupied property held for sale relates to property for which contracts have been exchanged but the sale had not completed during the current financial year. Interests in pooled investment funds and investment property held for sale continue to be measured based on the accounting policies that applied before they were classified as held for sale.

# 23. Unit linked liabilities and assets backing unit linked liabilities

The Group operates unit linked life assurance businesses through an insurance subsidiary. This subsidiary provides investment products through a life assurance wrapper. These products do not contain any features which transfer significant insurance risk and therefore are classified as investment contracts. Unit linked non-participating investment contracts are separated into two components being an investment management services component and a financial liability. All fees and related administrative expenses are deemed to be associated with the investment management services component (refer Note 3). The financial liability component is designated at FVTPL as it is implicitly managed on a fair value basis as its value is directly linked to the market value of the underlying portfolio of assets.

Where the Group is deemed to control an investment vehicle as a result of holdings in that vehicle by subsidiaries to back unit linked non-participating investment contract liabilities, the assets and liabilities of the vehicle are consolidated within the Group's statement of financial position. The liability for third party interest in such consolidated funds is presented as a unit linked liability.

Unit linked liabilities and assets backing unit linked liabilities are presented separately in the consolidated statement of financial position except for those held in operations held for sale, which are presented in assets and liabilities held for sale in the consolidated statement of financial position.

Contributions received on non-participating investment contracts and from third party interest in consolidated funds are treated as deposits and not reported as revenue in the consolidated income statement.

Withdrawals paid out to policyholders on non-participating investment contracts and to third party interest in consolidated funds are treated as a reduction to deposits and not recognised as expenses in the consolidated income statement.

Investment return and related benefits credited in respect of non-participating investment contracts and third party interest in consolidated funds are recognised in the consolidated income statement as changes in investment contract liabilities and changes in liability for third party interest in consolidated funds respectively. Investment returns relating to unit linked business are for the account of policyholders and have an equal and opposite effect on income and expenses in the consolidated income statement with no impact on profit or loss after tax.

Assets backing unit linked liabilities comprise financial investments, which are all classified as FVTPL on a mandatory basis, and receivables and other financial assets and cash and cash equivalents which are measured at amortised cost.

## (a) Result for the year attributable to unit linked business

| | Notes | 2023 £m | 2022 £m |
|---|---|---|---|
| Net gains or losses on financial instruments and other income | 4 | 4 | 5 |
| Other administrative expense | 5 | (1) | (1) |
| Profit before tax | | 3 | 4 |
| Tax expense attributable to unit linked business | 9 | (3) | (4) |
| Profit after tax | | – | – |

## (b) Financial instrument risk management

The shareholder is not directly exposed to market risk or credit risk in relation to the financial assets backing unit linked liabilities. The shareholder's exposure to market risk on these assets is limited to variations in the value of future revenue as fees are based on a percentage of fund value.

The shareholder is exposed to liquidity risk relating to unit linked funds. For the unit linked business, liquidity risk is primarily managed by holding a range of diversified instruments which are assessed against cash flow and funding requirements. A core portfolio of assets is maintained and invested in accordance with the mandates of the relevant unit linked funds. Given that unit linked policyholders can usually choose to surrender, in part or in full, their unit linked contracts at any time, the non-participating investment contract unit linked liabilities are designated as payable within one year. Such surrenders would be matched in practice, if necessary, by sales of underlying assets. Policyholder behaviour and the trading position of asset classes are actively monitored. The Group can delay settling liabilities to unit linked policyholders to ensure fairness between those remaining in the fund and those leaving the fund. The length of any such delay is dependent on the underlying financial assets.

(c) Fair value measurement of unit linked financial liabilities and financial assets backing unit linked liabilities

Each of the unit linked financial liabilities and the financial assets backing unit linked liabilities has been categorised below using the fair value hierarchy as defined in Note 36. Refer Note 36 for details of valuation techniques used.

| | Level 1 | | Level 2 | | Level 3 | | Not at fair value | | Total | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 |
| | £m | £m | £m | £m | £m | £m | £m | £m | £m | £m |
| Financial investments | 396 | 601 | 273 | 322 | - | 1 | - | - | 669 | 924 |
| Receivables and other financial assets | - | - | - | - | - | - | 4 | 5 | 4 | 5 |
| Cash and cash equivalents | - | - | - | - | - | - | 13 | 23 | 13 | 23 |
| Total financial assets backing unit linked liabilities | 396 | 601 | 273 | 322 | - | 1 | 17 | 28 | 686 | 952 |
| Investment contract liabilities | - | - | 684 | 772 | - | 1 | - | - | 684 | 773 |
| Third party interest in consolidated funds | - | - | - | 173 | - | - | - | - | - | 173 |
| Other unit linked financial liabilities | - | - | - | 2 | - | - | 2 | 4 | 2 | 6 |
| Total unit linked financial liabilities | - | - | 684 | 947 | - | 1 | 2 | 4 | 686 | 952 |

In addition to financial assets backing unit linked liabilities and unit linked financial liabilities shown above there is a current tax asset of £nil (2022: less than £1m) included in unit linked assets and a current tax liability of £nil (2022: less than £1m) included in unit linked liabilities.

The financial investments backing unit linked liabilities comprise equity securities and interests in pooled investment funds of £667m (2022: £811m), debt securities of £2m (2022: £112m) and derivative financial assets of £nil (2022: £1m).

The fair value of financial instruments not held at fair value approximates to their carrying value at both 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022.

There were no significant transfers from level 1 to level 2 during the year ended 31 December 2023. There were transfers from level 1 to level 2 of £52m during the year ended 31 December 2022. The Group now considers government bonds not issued by the G7 countries or the European Union as level 2. There were no significant transfers from level 2 to level 1 during the year ended 31 December 2023 (2022: £nil). Transfers are deemed to have occurred at the end of the calendar quarter in which they arose.

The movements during the period of level 3 unit linked assets and liabilities held at fair value are analysed below.

| | Equity securities and interests in pooled investment funds | | Investment contract liabilities | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | 31 Dec 2023 | 31 Dec 2022 | 31 Dec 2023 | 31 Dec 2022 |
| | £m | £m | £m | £m |
| At start of period | 1 | 1 | (1) | (1) |
| Sales | (1) | - | 1 | - |
| At end of period | - | 1 | - | (1) |

Unit linked level 3 assets related to holdings in real estate funds. No individual unobservable input is considered significant. Changing unobservable inputs in the measurement of the fair value of these unit linked level 3 financial assets and liabilities to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would have no impact on profit attributable to equity holders or on total assets.

Transfers of unit linked assets and liabilities to level 3 generally arise when external pricing providers stop providing prices for the underlying assets and liabilities in the funds or where the price provided is considered stale.

## 24. Issued share capital and share premium

Shares are classified as equity instruments when there is no contractual obligation to deliver cash or other assets to another entity on terms that may be unfavourable. The Company's share capital consists of the number of ordinary shares in issue multiplied by their nominal value. The difference between the proceeds received on issue of the shares and the nominal value of the shares issued is recorded in share premium.

Where the Company undertakes share buybacks, the reduction to retained earnings is accounted for on the trade date of the transaction of each repurchase with a liability recognised for unsettled trades, unless the Company has an irrevocable contractual obligation with a third party. Where the Company has an irrevocable contractual obligation, the full contractual value of the buyback programme is recognised as a liability and as a reduction to retained earnings on the date of the agreement. The reduction to share capital for the cancellation of the shares and the related credit to the capital redemption reserve is always accounted for on the settlement date for the repurchases.

The movement in the issued ordinary share capital and share premium of the Company was:

|  | 2023 |  | 2022 |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Issued shares fully paid | Ordinary share capital<br>13 61/63p each | Share premium<br>£m | Ordinary share capital<br>13 61/63p each | Share premium<br>£m |
| At 1 January | 2,001,891,899 | 280 | 640 | 2,180,724,786 | 305 | 640 |
| Shares issued in respect of share incentive plans | 2,414 | - | - | 2,381 | - | - |
| Share buyback | (161,153,949) | (23) | - | (178,835,268) | (25) | - |
| At 31 December | 1,840,740,364 | 257 | 640 | 2,001,891,899 | 280 | 640 |

All ordinary shares in issue in the Company rank pari passu and carry the same voting rights and entitlement to receive dividends and other distributions declared or paid by the Company.

On 5 June 2023, the Company announced that it would initiate a £150m return to shareholders. On 8 August 2023, the Company announced the extension of this programme to £300m. The share buyback commenced on 5 June 2023 and was completed on 19 December 2023. During the year ended 31 December 2023, the Company had bought back and cancelled 161,153,949 shares as part of this programme. The total consideration was £302m which includes transaction costs.

During the year ended 31 December 2022, the Company bought back and cancelled 178,835,268 shares. The total consideration was £302m which included transaction costs. There were no unsettled purchases at 31 December 2022.

The share buyback has resulted in a reduction in retained earnings of £302m (2022: £302m).

In addition, an amount of £23m (2022: £25m) has been credited to the capital redemption reserve relating to the nominal value of the shares cancelled.

The Company can issue shares to satisfy awards granted under employee incentive plans which have been approved by shareholders. Details of the Group's employee plans are provided in Note 40.

## 25. Shares held by trusts

Shares held by trusts relates to shares in abrdn plc that are held by the abrdn Employee Benefit Trust (abrdn EBT), the abrdn Employee Trust (formerly named the Standard Life Employee Trust)(abrdn ET) and the Aberdeen Asset Management Employee Benefit Trust 2003 (AAM EBT).

The abrdn EBT, abrdn ET and AAM EBT purchase shares in the Company for delivery to employees under employee incentive plans. Purchased shares are recognised as a deduction from equity at the price paid. Where new shares are issued to the abrdn EBT, abrdn ET or AAM EBT the price paid is the nominal value of the shares. When shares are distributed from the trust their corresponding value is released to retained earnings.

The number of shares held by trusts was as follows:

| Number of shares held by trusts | 2023 | 2022 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| abrdn Employee Benefit Trust | 34,076,343 | 36,112,240 |
| abrdn Employee Trust | 22,187,644 | 22,629,035 |

3. Other movements in 2022 included the transfer of (£17m) previously recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve (which is part of Other reserves) to Retained earnings. In prior years we have considered the functional currency of an intermediate subsidiary holding the Group's investment in HDFC Life to be US Dollars. We now consider that the functional currency should have been GBP, resulting in the current period transfer between reserves. Prior periods have not been restated as the impact on prior periods is not considered material.

# 27. Movements in other reserves
In July 2006 Standard Life Group demutualised and during this process the merger reserve, the reserve arising on Group reconstruction and the special reserve were created.

**Merger reserve:** the merger reserve consists of two components. Firstly at demutualisation in July 2006 the Company issued shares to former members of the mutual company. The difference between the nominal value of these shares and their issue value was recognised in the merger reserve. The reserve includes components attaching to each subsidiary that was transferred to the Company at demutualisation based on their fair value at that date. Secondly following the completion of the merger of Standard Life plc and Aberdeen Asset Management PLC on 14 August 2017, an additional amount was recognised in the merger reserve representing the difference between the nominal value of shares issued to shareholders of Aberdeen Asset Management PLC and their fair value at that date. On disposal or impairment of a subsidiary any related component of the merger reserve is released to retained earnings.

**Reserve arising on Group reconstruction:** The value of the shares issued at demutualisation was equal to the fair value of the business at that date. The business's assets and liabilities were recognised at their book value at the time of demutualisation. The difference between the book value of the business's net assets and its fair value was recognised in the reserve arising on Group reconstruction. The reserve comprises components attaching to each subsidiary that was transferred to the Company at demutualisation. On disposal of such a subsidiary any related component of the reserve arising on Group reconstruction is released to retained earnings.

**Special reserve:** Immediately following demutualisation and the related initial public offering, the Company reduced its share premium reserve by court order giving rise to the special reserve. Dividends can be paid out of this reserve.

**Capital redemption reserve:** In August 2018, as part of the return of capital and share buyback the capital redemption reserve was created. Additional capital redemption reserve is created by subsequent buybacks (refer Note 24). See below for the cancellation of the capital redemption reserve as at 1 July 2022.

1. Other movements included the transfer of (£17m) previously recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve to Retained earnings. In prior periods we had considered the functional currency of an intermediate subsidiary holding the Group's investment in HDFC Life to be US Dollars. We now consider that the functional currency should have been GBP, resulting in the transfer between reserves. Prior periods were not restated as the impact on prior periods was not considered material. There was no impact on net assets for any period presented.

On 1 July 2022, the Company's capital redemption reserve at this date was cancelled in accordance with section 649 of the Companies Act 2006 resulting in a transfer of £1,059m to retained earnings.

## 28. Other equity and non-controlling interests
Perpetual subordinated notes issued by abrdn plc are classified as other equity where no contractual obligation to deliver cash exists.

### (a) Other equity – perpetual subordinated notes
**5.25% Fixed Rate Reset Perpetual Subordinated Contingent Convertible Notes**
On 13 December 2021, the Company issued £210m of 5.25% Fixed Rate Reset Perpetual Subordinated Contingent Convertible Notes (the 'Notes'). These were classified as other equity and initially recognised at £207m (proceeds received less issuance costs of £3m).

The Notes initially bear interest on their principal amount at 5.25% per annum payable semi-annually in arrears on 13 June and 13 December in each year. The interest rate is subject to reset on 13 June 2027 and then every five years thereafter. The payments of interest are discretionary and non-cumulative. The interest paid is recognised as profit attributable to other equity when paid. The profit for the year attributable to other equity was £11m (2022: £11m).

The Notes have no fixed redemption date. The Company has the option to redeem the Notes (in full) between 13 December 2026 and 13 June 2027 and every five years thereafter. The Notes are convertible to ordinary shares in abrdn plc at a conversion price of £1.6275 (fixed subject to adjustment for share corporate actions e.g. share consolidations in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Notes) if the Group IFPR CET1 Ratio falls below 70%. The IFPR CET1 ratio at 31 December 2023 was 467% (2022: 408%).

### (b) Non-controlling interests – ordinary shares
Non-controlling interests – ordinary shares of £5m were held at 31 December 2023 (2022: £7m). The profit for the year attributable to non-controlling interests – ordinary shares was less than £1m (2022: £1m).

## 29. Financial liabilities
Management determines the classification of financial liabilities at initial recognition. Financial liabilities which are managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are designated as at fair value through profit or loss. Changes in the fair value of these financial liabilities are recognised in the consolidated income statement.

Derivatives are also measured at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in Net gains or losses on financial instruments and other income in the consolidated income statement except for derivative instruments that are designated as a cash flow hedge or net investment hedge. The classification of derivatives and the accounting treatment of derivatives designated as a hedging instrument are set out in Note 18.

Except for contingent consideration liabilities which are measured at fair value, other financial liabilities are classified as being subsequently measured at amortised cost. Amortised cost is calculated, and the related interest expense is recognised in the consolidated income statement, using the effective interest method.

All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less, in the case of financial liabilities subsequently measured at amortised cost, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue of the liability.

Where the terms of a financial liability measured at amortised cost are modified and the modification does not result in the derecognition of the liability, the liability is adjusted to the net present value of the future cash flows less transaction costs with a modification gain or loss recognised in the income statement.

The methods and assumptions used to determine fair value of financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss and derivatives are discussed in Note 36.

The table below sets out an analysis of financial liabilities excluding unit linked financial liabilities which are set out in Note 23.

| | | At fair value through profit or loss<sup>1</sup> | | At amortised cost | | Total | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | Notes | 2023 £m | 2022 £m | 2023 £m | 2022 £m | 2023 £m | 2022 £m |
| Third party interest in consolidated funds | | 187 | 242 | - | - | 187 | 242 |
| Subordinated liabilities | 30 | - | - | 599 | 621 | 599 | 621 |
| Derivative financial liabilities | 18 | 9 | 1 | - | - | 9 | 1 |
| Other financial liabilities<sup>2</sup> | 32 | 129 | 143 | 1,112 | 1,058 | 1,241 | 1,201 |
| Total | | 325 | 386 | 1,711 | 1,679 | 2,036 | 2,065 |

1. All financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss have been classified at FVTPL on a mandatory basis except for third party interest in consolidated funds which the Group has designated as at FVTPL.
2. The Group has made a presentational change to show Deferred income within Other financial liabilities. Refer Note 32.

# 30. Subordinated liabilities

Subordinated liabilities are debt instruments issued by the Company which rank below its other obligations in the event of liquidation but above the share capital. Subordinated liabilities are initially recognised at the value of proceeds received after deduction of issue expenses. Subsequent measurement is at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

|  | | 2023 | | 2022 | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | Notes | Principal amount | Carrying value | Principal amount | Carrying value |
| Subordinated notes | | | | | |
| 4.25% US Dollar fixed rate due 30 June 2028 | | $750m | £599m | $750m | £621m |
| Total subordinated liabilities | 36 | | £599m | | £621m |

A description of the key features of the Group's subordinated liabilities as at 31 December 2023 is as follows:

| | 4.25% US Dollar fixed rate¹ |
| --- | --- |
| Principal amount | $750m |
| Issue date | 18 October 2017 |
| Maturity date | 30 June 2028 |
| Callable at par at option of the Company from | Not applicable |
| If not called by the Company interest will reset to | Not applicable |

1. The cash flows arising from the US dollar subordinated notes give rise to foreign exchange exposure which the Group manages with a cross-currency swap designated as a cash flow hedge. Refer Note 18 for further details.

The difference between the fair value and carrying value of the subordinated liabilities is presented in Note 36. A reconciliation of movements in subordinated liabilities in the year is provided in Note 37.

The principal amount of the subordinated liabilities is expected to be settled after more than 12 months. The accrued interest on the subordinated liabilities of £13m (2022: £nil) is expected to be settled within 12 months.

During the year ended 31 December 2022, the Group redeemed subordinated liabilities with the following key features:

| | 5.5% Sterling fixed rate |
| --- | --- |
| Principal amount | £92m |
| Issue date | 4 December 2012 |
| Maturity date | 4 December 2042 |
| Callable at par at option of the Company from | 4 December 2022 and on every interest payment date (semi-annually) thereafter |
| If not called by the Company interest will reset to | 4.85% over the five-year gilt rate (and at each fifth anniversary) |

The 5.5% Sterling fixed rate subordinated notes with a principal amount of £92m were redeemed on 4 December 2022.

## 31. Pension and other post-retirement benefit provisions

The Group operates two types of pension plans:
– Defined benefit plans which provide pension payments upon retirement to members as defined by the plan rules. All of the Group's defined benefit plans, with the exception of a small plan in Ireland, are closed to future service accrual.
– Defined contribution plans where the Group makes contributions to a member's pension plan but has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.

The Group's liabilities in relation to its defined benefit plans are valued by at least annual actuarial calculations. The Group has funded these liabilities in relation to its UK and Ireland defined benefit plans by ring-fencing assets in trustee-administered funds. The Group has further smaller defined benefit plans some of which are unfunded.

The statement of financial position reflects a net asset or net liability for each defined benefit pension plan. The liability recognised is the present value of the defined benefit obligation (estimated future cash flows are discounted using the yields on high quality corporate bonds) less the fair value of plan assets, if any. If the fair value of the plan assets exceeds the defined benefit obligation, a pension surplus is only recognised if the Group considers that it has an unconditional right to a refund of the surplus from the plan. The amount of surplus recognised will be limited by tax and expenses. Our judgement is that, in the UK, an authorised surplus tax charge is not an income tax. Consequently, any UK surplus is recognised net of this tax charge rather than the tax charge being included within deferred taxation.

For the principal defined benefit plan (abrdn UK Group plan), the Group considers that it has an unconditional right to a refund of a surplus, assuming the gradual settlement of the plan liabilities over time until all members have left the plan. The plan trustees can purchase annuities to insure member benefits and can, for the majority of benefits, transfer these annuities to members. The trustees cannot unconditionally wind up the plan or use the surplus to enhance member benefits without employer consent. Our judgement is that these trustee rights do not prevent us from recognising an unconditional right to a refund and therefore a surplus.

Net interest income (if a plan is in surplus) or interest expense (if a plan is in deficit) is calculated using yields on high quality corporate bonds and recognised in the consolidated income statement. A current service cost is also recognised which represents the expected present value of the defined benefit pension entitlement earned by members in the period. A past service cost is also recognised which represents the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation for service in prior periods, resulting from an amendment or curtailment to a plan.

Remeasurements, which include gains and losses as a result of changes in actuarial assumptions, the effect of the limit on the plan surplus and returns on plan assets (other than amounts included in net interest) are recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.

For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to separately administered pension plans. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised in current service cost in the consolidated income statement as staff costs and other employee-related costs when they are due.

# Defined contribution plans
The defined contribution plans comprise a mixture of arrangements depending on the employing entity and other factors. Some of these plans are located within the same legal vehicles as defined benefit plans. The Group contributes a percentage of pensionable salary to each employee's plan. The contribution levels vary by employing entity and other factors.

# Defined benefit plans
## UK plans
These plans are governed by trustee boards, which comprise employer and employee nominated trustees and an independent trustee. The plans are subject to the statutory funding objective requirements of the Pensions Act 2004, which require that plans be funded to at least the level of their technical provisions (an actuarial estimate of the assets needed to provide for benefits already built-up under the plan). The trustees perform regular valuations to check that the plans meet the statutory funding objective.

While the IAS 19 valuation reflects a best estimate of the financial position of the plan, the funding valuation reflects a prudent estimate. There is no material difference in how assets are measured. The funding measure of liabilities (technical provisions) and the IAS 19 measure are materially different. The key differences are the discount rate and inflation assumptions. While IAS 19 requires that the discount rate reflect corporate bond yields, the funding measure discount rate reflects a prudent estimate of future investment return based on the actual investment strategy. The funding valuation adopts a market consistent measure of inflation without any adjustment. The IAS 19 RPI inflation assumption is derived from market-implied RPI inflation with an adjustment to remove the inflation risk premium believed to exist within market prices, with an additional deduction required to derive the IAS 19 CPI inflation assumption (to reflect differences between RPI and CPI).

The trustees set the plan investment strategy to protect the ratio of plan assets to the trustees' measure of the value of assets needed to meet the trustees' objectives. This investment strategy does not aim to protect the IAS 19 surplus or the ratio of plan assets to the IAS 19 measure of liabilities.

After consulting the relevant employers, the trustees prepare statements of funding and investment principles and set a schedule of contributions. If necessary, this schedule includes a recovery plan that aims to restore the funding level to the level of the technical provisions.

| Plan | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **abrdn UK Group (SLSPS) plan (principal plan)** | This is the Group's principal defined benefit plan. The plan closed to new membership in 2004 and changed from a final salary basis to a revalued career average salary basis in 2008. Accrual ceased in April 2016.<br><br>Following a High Court ruling against a third party's pension scheme in 2018, that required pension schemes to address inequalities for the effect of unequal GMPs accrued between May 1990 and April 1997, an allowance for assumed equalisation was recognised as a past service cost for our principal defined benefit plan in 2018 and this adjustment has been carried forward to 2023. There was a further judgement in 2020 requiring pension schemes to address inequalities for the effect of unequal GMPs for those beneficiaries that transferred out of the scheme between May 1990 and October 2018. The estimated impact is immaterial and was recognised as a past service cost in 2020 and this adjustment has been carried forward to 2023.<br><br>The funding of the plan depends on the statutory valuation performed by the trustee, and the relevant employers, with the assistance of the scheme actuary – i.e. not the IAS 19 valuation. The funding valuation was last completed at 31 December 2022, and measured plan assets and liabilities to be £3.0bn and £2.1bn respectively. This corresponds to a surplus of £0.9bn and a funding level of 144%. As there is currently no deficit, no recovery plan is required.<br><br>As part of ongoing actions taken in recent years to reduce risk in abrdn's principal defined benefit pension plan, the trustee submitted a petition to the Court of Session in March 2023 seeking a direction on the destination of any residual surplus assets that remain after all plan-related obligations are settled or otherwise provided for. On 1 August 2023, the Court of Session, among other things, confirmed that if a buy-out were to be completed and sufficient provision made for: (i) any remaining liabilities; and (ii) expenses of completing the winding-up of the pension scheme, there would be a resulting trust in respect of any residual surplus assets in favour of the employer. We are continuing to work with the trustee on next steps. Any residual surplus will be determined on a different basis to IAS 19 or funding measures of the plan surplus. The timing of release of any surplus remains a matter for the trustee. The IAS 19 defined benefit plan asset is not included in abrdn's regulatory capital. |
| **Other UK plans** | The Group also operates two UK defined benefit plans as a result of the acquisition of Aberdeen Asset Management PLC (now renamed abrdn Holdings Limited) in 2017. These plans are final salary based, with benefits depending on members' length of service and salary prior to retirement. At the last statutory valuation date (30 June 2022), one plan, the Edinburgh Fund Managers Group Scheme (the EFM Scheme) was in deficit and the Group agreed funding plans with the plan's trustees which aimed to eliminate the deficit. The other plan, the Murray Johnstone Limited Retirement Benefits Plan (the MJ Plan), was in surplus. Refer Section 31(d) for details of the buy-in undertaken on the MJ Plan in 2023. |

## Other plans
| Plan | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **abrdn ROI plan** | In December 2009, this plan closed to new membership and changed from a final salary basis to a career average revalued earnings (CARE) basis. Following the sale of the UK and European insurance business in 2018, there remain two employees who continue to accrue benefits under this plan.<br><br>At the last funding valuation, effective 1 January 2022, the plan was in deficit and as above, the Group agreed funding plans with the plan's trustees which aimed to eliminate the deficit. |
| **Other** | The Group operates smaller funded and unfunded defined benefit plans in other countries. |

## Plan regulations
The plans are administered according to local laws and regulations in each country. Responsibility for the governance of the plans rests with the relevant trustee boards (or equivalent). The UK pensions market is regulated by the Pensions Regulator whose statutory objectives and regulatory powers are described on its website, www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk

## (a) Analysis of amounts recognised in the consolidated income statement
The amounts recognised in the consolidated income statement for defined contribution and defined benefit plans are as follows:

|  | 2023 | 2022 |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | £m | £m |
| Current service cost | 55 | 56 |
| Past service cost | (5) | – |
| Net interest income | (38) | (32) |
| Administrative expenses | 4 | 3 |
| Expense recognised in the consolidated income statement | 16 | 27 |

Contributions made to defined contribution plans are included within current service cost.

Contributions to defined benefit plans in the year ended 31 December 2023 comprised £8m (2022: £14m) to the Other UK plans and the abrdn ROI plan. Contributions are expected to be £5m in 2024 and are not expected to materially change in the two subsequent years. These contributions include a mixture of deficit funding and funding to achieve a targeted level of overall financial strength.

## (b) Analysis of amounts recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position

|  | 2023 |  |  | 2022 |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Net asset/(liability) | 734 | (6) | 728 | 810 | 9 | 819 |

1. UK recoverable surpluses are reduced to reflect an authorised surplus payments charge of 35% that would arise on a refund. This applies to both the principal plan surplus and the defined benefit plan within Other which has a net asset of £6m at 31 December 2023 (2022: £21m).
2. The UK Government announced in the Autumn Statement a proposed reduction in the authorised pension surplus charge from 35% to 25% to be effective from 6 April 2024. This change has not yet been enacted. The impact of the change would have been to increase the pension asset by £113m.

Other comprises a defined benefit plan asset of £6m (2022: £21m) and a number of other defined benefit plans with a total liability of £12m (2022: £12m).

A pension plan surplus is considered to be recoverable where an unconditional right to a refund exists. The principal plan surplus had reduced significantly in 2022 due to market movements, primarily driven by the increase in UK high quality bond yields with a smaller impact from UK inflation changes during 2022. There was further impact from these in 2023 but this was less significant.

## (d) Defined benefit plan assets

Investment strategy is directed by the trustee boards (where relevant) who pursue different strategies according to the characteristics and maturity profile of each plan's liabilities. Assets and liabilities are managed holistically to create a portfolio with the dual objectives of return generation and liability management. In the principal plan this is achieved through a diversified multi-asset absolute return strategy seeking consistent positive returns, and hedging techniques which protect liabilities against movements arising from changes in interest rates and inflation expectations. Derivative financial instruments support both of these objectives and may lead to increased or decreased exposures to the physical asset categories disclosed below.

To provide more information on the approach used to determine and measure the fair value of the plan assets, the fair value hierarchy has been used as defined in Note 36. Those assets which cannot be classified as level 1 have been presented together as level 2 or 3.

The distribution of the fair value of the assets of the Group's funded defined benefit plans is as follows:

| | Principal plan | | Other | | Total | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | 2023 £m | 2022 £m | 2023 £m | 2022 £m | 2023 £m | 2022 £m |
| **Assets measured at fair value based on level 1 inputs** | | | | | | |
| Derivatives | - | 9 | - | - | - | 9 |
| Equity securities | - | 55 | - | - | - | 55 |
| Debt securities | 1,403 | 2,186 | - | 93 | 1,403 | 2,279 |
| **Total assets measured at fair value based on level 1 inputs** | 1,403 | 2,250 | - | 93 | 1,403 | 2,343 |
| **Assets measured at fair value based on level 2 or 3 inputs** | | | | | | |
| Derivatives | (3) | (7) | (2) | (3) | (5) | (10) |
| Equity securities | 44 | 55 | - | - | 44 | 55 |
| **Interests in pooled investment funds** | | | | | | |
| Debt | 286 | 284 | 19 | 16 | 305 | 300 |
| Equity | - | - | 7 | 6 | 7 | 6 |
| Multi-asset private markets | 230 | 224 | - | - | 230 | 224 |
| Property | 82 | 95 | 11 | 12 | 93 | 107 |
| Absolute return | - | - | 9 | 24 | 9 | 24 |
| Cash | 9 | 39 | 73 | 41 | 82 | 80 |
| Debt securities | 1,110 | 581 | 2 | 12 | 1,112 | 593 |
| Qualifying insurance policies | 2 | 2 | 125 | 45 | 127 | 47 |
| **Total assets measured at fair value based on level 2 or 3 inputs** | 1,760 | 1,273 | 244 | 153 | 2,004 | 1,426 |
| Cash and cash equivalents | 103 | 160 | 4 | 5 | 107 | 165 |
| Liability in respect of collateral held | (354) | (682) | (15) | - | (369) | (682) |
| **Total** | 2,912 | 3,001 | 233 | 251 | 3,145 | 3,252 |

Further information on risks is provided at Section (g) of this Note. The £2,515m (2022: £2,872m) of debt securities includes £1,608m (2022: £2,550m) of government bonds (including conventional and index-linked). Of the remaining £907m (2022: £322m) debt securities, £815m (2022: £190m) are investment grade corporate bonds or certificates of deposit.

Included in the qualifying insurance policy asset of £127m (2022: £47m) is £121m (2022: £42m) in relation to two insurance policies purchased by the trustees of Other UK defined benefit plans to protect the plans against future investment and actuarial risks.

- £43m (2022: £42m) in relation to the partial buy-in completed on the EFM Scheme in 2015.
- £78m (2022: £nil) in relation to the substantially full buy-in completed on the MJ Plan in 2023. The premium paid was £99m.

The MJ Plan buy-in is not considered to be a settlement therefore, as noted above, the insurance policy has been recognised within the plan assets. The buy-in transaction was an investment decision made by the trustee to increase the security of plan benefits. The insurance policy does provide the option to convert the buy-in into individual policies which would transfer the future obligation to pay pensions to the insurer for the members covered by the policy (known as a buy-out). However, this obligation remains with the Group and while the conversion to a buy-out may be considered in the future, a separate decision will be required, and certain conditions will need to be met, including changes to the MJ Plan's trust deed and rules, before any buy-out can be executed. Consequently the difference between the valuation of the policy and the premium paid has been recognised within Remeasurement (losses)/gains recognised in other comprehensive income.

On completion of the MJ Plan buy-in, a contract in place to hedge longevity risk for pensioners on this plan was derecognised. The fair value of this derivative at 31 December 2022 was a liability of £1m.

The £369m liability in respect of collateral held (2022: £682m) consists of repurchase agreements of £353m (2022: £652m), margins on derivatives of (£8m) (2022: (£10m)) and collateral of £24m (2022: £40m).

(e) Estimates and assumptions
Determination of the valuation of principal plan liabilities is a key estimate as a result of the assumptions made relating to both economic and non-economic factors.

The key economic assumptions for the principal plan, which are based in part on current market conditions, are shown below:

|  | 2023 | 2022 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Discount rate | 4.60 | 4.85 |
| Rates of inflation |  |  |
| Consumer Price Index (CPI) | 2.65 | 2.75 |
| Retail Price Index (RPI) | 3.00 | 3.10 |

The changes in economic assumptions over the period reflect changes in both corporate bond prices and market implied inflation. The underlying methodology used to set these assumptions has not changed over the reporting period. The population of corporate bond prices excludes bonds issued by UK universities. The inflation assumption reflects the future reform of RPI effective from 2030 as described in Section (g)(i) below.

The most significant non-economic assumption for the principal plan is post-retirement longevity which is inherently uncertain. These non-economic assumptions have been updated for the current reporting date. The longevity assumptions (along with sample expectations of life) are illustrated below:

| 2023 Table | Improvements | Normal Retirement Age (NRA) | Expectation of life from NRA |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  | Male age today | Female age today |
|  |  |  | NRA | 40 | NRA | 40 |
| Plan specific basis (calibrated by Club Vita) reflecting membership demographics | Core parameterisation of the CMI 2021 mortality improvements model (SK parameter of 7.0), with an initial improvement (or 'A') parameter of +0.5% for males and females, and a long-term rate of improvement of 1.5%. | 60 | 27 | 28 | 29 | 31 |

| 2022 Table | Improvements | Normal Retirement Age (NRA) | Expectation of life from NRA |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  | Male age today | Female age today |
|  |  |  | NRA | 40 | NRA | 40 |
| Plan specific basis (calibrated by Club Vita) reflecting membership demographics | Core parameterisation of the CMI 2019 mortality improvements model (SK parameter of 7.0), with an initial improvement (or 'A') parameter of +0.5% for males and females, and a long-term rate of improvement of 1.5%. | 60 | 27 | 29 | 29 | 31 |

These assumptions reflect a cautious allowance for the recently observed slowdown in longevity improvements. The updated mortality improvement assumptions are in line with CMI 2021 but with a 10% weighting on 2020 and 2021 data. This makes some allowance for recent post-pandemic experience whilst recognising that greater stability in recent 2022 mortality experience may be indicative of expected future trends.

The weighted average duration is calculated based on discounted benefit payments so is impacted by changes in the discount and inflation rates used (Refer Section (e)).

## (g) Risk
### (g)(i) Risks and mitigating actions
The Group's consolidated statement of financial position is exposed to movements in the defined benefit plans' net asset. In particular, the consolidated statement of financial position could be materially sensitive to reasonably likely movements in the principal assumptions for the principal plan. By having offered post-retirement defined benefit pension plans the Group is exposed to a number of risks. An explanation of the key risks and mitigating actions in place for the principal plan is given below.

#### Asset volatility
Investment strategy risks include underperformance of the absolute return strategy and underperformance of the liability hedging strategy. As the trustees set investment strategy to protect their own view of plan strength (not the IAS 19 position), changes in the IAS 19 liabilities (e.g. due to movements in corporate bond prices) may not always result in a similar movement in plan assets.

Failure of the asset strategy to keep pace with changes in plan liabilities would expose the plan to the risk of a deficit developing, which could increase funding requirements for the Group. abrdn and the trustees are working together to determine the most appropriate de-risking strategy to best protect against the risk that this plan strength deteriorates in the future.

#### Yields/discount rate
Falls in yields would in isolation be expected to increase the defined benefit plan liabilities.

The principal plan uses both bonds and derivatives to hedge out yield risks on the relevant plan basis in order to meet the trustee's objectives, rather than the IAS 19 basis, which is expected to minimise the plan's need to rely on support from the Group.

# Inflation

Increases in inflation expectations would in isolation be expected to increase the defined benefit plan liabilities.

The principal plan uses both bonds and derivatives to hedge out inflation risks on the relevant plan basis in order to meet the objectives, rather than the IAS 19 basis, which is expected to minimise the plan's need to rely on support from the Group.

In the principal plan, pensions in payment are generally linked to CPI, however inflationary risks are hedged using RPI instruments due to lack of availability of CPI linked instruments. Therefore, the plan is exposed to movements in the actual and expected long-term gap between RPI and CPI.

A House of Lords report in 2019 raised the potential for changes to the RPI measure of inflation, which was followed by recommendations from the UK Statistics Authority. The results of the consultation on the reform of RPI (announced on 25 November 2020) confirmed that RPI will be aligned to CPIH (CPI excluding owner occupiers' housing costs) as proposed, but not before 2030. While uncertainty remains, there is a risk that future cash flows from, and thus the value of, the plan's RPI-linked assets fall without a corresponding reduction in the plan's CPI-linked liabilities. While not directly observable from market data, the plan's RPI-linked asset values may already reflect an element of the expected changes and risk of such changes.

## Life expectancy

Increases in life expectancy beyond those currently assumed will lead to an increase in plan liabilities. Regular reviews of longevity assumptions are performed to ensure assumptions remain appropriate.

## Climate

The principal plan adopts a low-risk strategy to investment, with the majority of plan assets invested in UK government bonds. The trustees have assessed the principal plan's exposure to severe climate change as being minimal, as a result of the low-risk investment strategy alongside the plan's strong funding level.

## (g)(ii) Sensitivity to key assumptions

The sensitivity of the principal plan's obligation and assets to the key assumptions is disclosed below.

| Change in assumption | (Increase)/decrease in present value of obligation 2023 £m | Increase/(decrease) in fair value of plan assets 2023 £m | (Increase)/decrease in present value of obligation 2022 £m | Increase/(decrease) in fair value of plan assets 2022 £m |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Yield/discount rate Decrease by 1% (e.g. from 4.60% to 3.60%) | (342) | 566 | (341) | 698 |
| Increase by 1% | 266 | (432) | 268 | (525) |
| Rates of inflation Decrease by 1% | 233 | (371) | 235 | (445) |
| Increase by 1% | (306) | 485 | (305) | 591 |
| Life expectancy Decrease by 1 year | 54 | N/A | 60 | N/A |
| Increase by 1 year | (54) | N/A | (60) | N/A |

## 33. Provisions and other liabilities

Provisions are obligations of the Group which are of uncertain timing or amount. They are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that a loss will be incurred in settling the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.

Where some or all of the expenditure required to settle a provision is expected to be reimbursed by another party, a separate reimbursement asset is recognised when it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received if the Group settles the obligation.

### (a) Provisions

The movement in provisions during the year is as follows:

| | Separation costs | | Process execution | | Tax related provisions | | Other provisions | | Total provisions | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | 2023 £m | 2022 £m | 2023 £m | 2022 £m | 2023 £m | 2022 £m | 2023 £m | 2022 £m | 2023 £m | 2022 £m |
| At 1 January | 33 | 35 | 41 | - | - | - | 23 | 14 | 97 | 49 |
| Reclassified as held for sale during the year | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | (2) | - | (2) |
| Charged/(credited) to the consolidated income statement | | | | | | | | | | |
| Additional provisions | - | - | - | 41 | 42 | - | 33 | 18 | 75 | 59 |
| Release of unused provision | (32) | - | - | - | - | - | (4) | (1) | (36) | (1) |
| Used during the year | (1) | (2) | (41) | - | - | - | (28) | (6) | (70) | (8) |
| At 31 December | - | 33 | - | 41 | 42 | - | 24 | 23 | 66 | 97 |

The separation cost provision recognised at 31 December 2022 of £33m was in respect of costs expected to be incurred following the sale of the UK and European insurance business to Phoenix. Following the completion of the separation programme during the year ended 31 December 2023 the Group expects no further costs to be incurred and £32m (2022: less than £1m) was released from the provision. The remaining costs covered by the provision at 31 December 2022 were expected to be incurred in the next year.

A provision for a potential liability of £42m (2022: £nil) relates to a disputed tax matter which is the subject of an ongoing appeal. Any resolution is expected to be after 12 months. A reimbursement asset has been recognised for £18m (2022: £nil) which is an expected recovery in the event of any settlement.

The process execution provision recognised at 31 December 2022 for £41m in respect of a payment required to compensate an asset management client relating to the provision of certain services has been fully utilised in the year ended 31 December 2023 to fully settle the compensation.

Following the settlement, the Group had agreed a recovery of £36m from its liability insurance, being the cost of the compensation net of a £5m excess of which £36m had been received by 31 December 2023. The recovery has been credited against Other administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement.

Other provisions primarily relates to restructuring and dilapidations on leased properties. Restructuring provisions are generally expected to be settled within 12 months. Dilapidations are generally expected to be settled after more than 12 months. Refer Note 16 for further details of the Group's leases.

The amount of provisions expected to be settled after more than 12 months is £45m (2022: £3m).

### (b) Other liabilities

As at 31 December 2023, other liabilities totalled £4m (2022: £8m). The amount of other liabilities expected to be settled after more than 12 months is £nil (2022: £3m).

# 34. Financial instruments risk management
## (a) Overview
The principal risks and uncertainties that affect the Group's business model and the Group's approach to risk management are set out in the Risk management section of the Strategic report.

The Group's exposure to financial instrument risk is derived from the financial instruments that it holds directly, the assets and liabilities of the unit linked funds of the life operations of the Group and the Group's defined benefit pension plans. In addition due to the nature of the business, the Group's secondary exposure extends to the impact on treasury income and investment management and other fees that are determined on the basis of a percentage of AUMA and are therefore impacted by financial risks borne by third party investors. In this Note, exposures and sensitivities provided relate to the financial instrument assets and liabilities, in scope of IFRS 7, to which the shareholder is directly exposed.

For the purposes of this Note:
- Shareholder business refers to the assets and liabilities to which the shareholder is directly exposed. The shareholder refers to the equity holders of the Company.
- Unit linked funds refers to the assets and liabilities of the unit linked funds of the life operations of the Group. It does not include the cash flows (such as asset management charges or investment expenses) arising from the unit linked fund contracts. These cash flows are included in shareholder business.
- Third party interest in consolidated funds and non-controlling interests refers to the assets and liabilities recorded on the Group's consolidated statement of financial position which belong to third parties. The Group controls the entities which own the assets and liabilities but the Group does not own 100% of the equity or units of the relevant entities.

Unit linked funds are excluded from the analysis in this Note. Details regarding the financial risks of instruments relating to the Group's unit linked funds can be found in Note 23 and the risks relating to the Group's principal defined benefit pension plan are explained in Note 31.

Third party interests in consolidated funds do not expose the shareholder to market, credit or liquidity risk since the financial risks from the assets and obligations are borne by third parties. As a result equity risk, interest rate risk and credit risk quantitative disclosures in this Note exclude these assets.

Under IFRS 7 the following financial instruments are excluded from scope:
- Interests in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.
- Rights and obligations arising from employee benefit plans.
- Insurance contracts as defined by IFRS 17.
- Share-based payment transactions.

For the purposes of managing risks to the Group's financial instrument assets and liabilities, the Group considers the following categories:

| Risk | Definition and exposure |
|------|-------------------------|
| Market | The risk of financial loss as a result of adverse financial market movements. The shareholder is directly exposed to the impact of movements in equity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates on the value of assets held by the shareholder business. |
| Credit | The risk of financial loss as a result of the failure of a counterparty, issuer or borrower to meet their obligations or perform them in a timely manner. The shareholder is directly exposed to credit risk from holding cash, debt securities, derivative financial instruments and receivables and other financial assets. |
| Liquidity | The risk of financial loss as a result of being unable to settle financial obligations when they fall due, as a result of having insufficient liquid resources or being unable to realise investments and other assets other than at excessive costs. The shareholder is directly exposed to the liquidity risk from the shareholder business if it is unable to realise investments and other assets in order to settle its financial obligations when they fall due, or can do so only at excessive cost. |

As set out in the Risk management section of the Strategic report, the Group reviews and manages climate related risks. We continue to assess the potential impacts on our business with a view to the resilience of our operations and investment strategies. This is monitored through our climate risk and opportunity radar to ensure we are well positioned to realise opportunities and mitigate risks. Our day-to-day business is predominantly exposed to transition risk as markets, policy, and reputations come to terms with alignment to net zero. We have a critical role to play as stewards of clients' capital and this is reflected in our business strategy and our commitment to reduce the carbon intensity of our portfolios and absolute emissions from our direct operations. The Group is also exposed to climate risk in relation to its investment property which are primarily properties which are no longer being used operationally by the Group and are being sublet. Refer Note 15 for details of the Group's consideration of climate related factors in relation to investment property. We have considered the implications of climate related risk, including transition risks, for the 2023 financial statements, and have concluded that there are no material impacts on the valuation of the Group's assets and liabilities including the valuation of financial instruments held at fair value through profit or loss (in particular in relation to level 3 investments) or at amortised cost (in particular in relation to expected credit losses).

# Group financial statements continued

(b) Market risk  
The Group's largest exposure to market risk relates to our investment in Phoenix. Other market risk exposures primarily arise as a result of holdings in newly established investment vehicles which the Group has seeded and co-investments in property and infrastructure funds in the Investments segment. Seed capital is classified as held for sale when it is the intention to dispose of the vehicle in a single transaction and within one year. Co-investments are typically held for a longer term and align the Group's economic interests with those of property, private equity and infrastructure fund co-investors. The consolidated statement of financial position includes the following amounts in respect of seed capital and co-investments.

|  | 2023 | 2022 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Equity securities and interests in pooled investment funds at FVTPL | 209 | 213 |
| Debt securities | 86 | 76 |
| Total seed capital | 295 | 289 |
|  |  |  |
| Equity securities and interests in pooled investment funds at FVTPL | 116 | 107 |
| Total co-investments | 116 | 107 |

The Group sets limits for investing in seed capital and co-investment activity and regularly monitors exposures arising from these investments. The Group will consider hedging its exposure to market risk in respect of seed capital investments where it is appropriate and efficient to do so. The Group will also consider hedging its exposure to currency risk in respect of co-investments where it is appropriate and efficient to do so. Other market risks associated with co-investments are not hedged given the need for the Group's economic interests to be aligned with those of the co-investors.

(b)(i) Elements of market risk  
The main elements of market risk to which the Group is exposed are equity risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk, which are discussed on the following pages.

Information on the methods used to determine fair values for each major category of financial instrument measured at fair value is presented in Note 36.

(b)(i)(i) Exposure to equity risk  
The Group is exposed to the risk of adverse equity market movements which could result in losses. This applies to daily changes in the market values and returns on the holdings in equity securities.

At 31 December 2023 the shareholder exposure to equity markets was £792m (2022: £1,577m) in relation to equity securities. This primarily relates to the Group's investments in Phoenix of £557m (2022: £634m), seed capital investments of £151m (2022: £171m), and equity securities held by the abrdn Financial Fairness Trust of £64m (2022: £61m). At 31 December 2022, equity securities also included the Group's investments in HDFC Life of £203m and HDFC Asset Management of £477m.

The Group is also exposed to adverse market price movements on its interests in pooled investment funds. The shareholder exposure of £235m (2022: £268m) to pooled investment funds primarily relates to £174m (2022: £149m) of seed capital and co-investments, investments in certain managed funds to hedge against liabilities from variable pay awards that are deferred and settled in cash by reference to the price of those funds of £35m (2022: £37m), pooled investment funds held by the abrdn Financial Fairness Trust of £22m (2022: £25m) and corporate funds held in absolute return funds of £nil (2022: £50m).

The Equities and interests in pooled investment funds at FVTPL included in the consolidated statement of financial position includes £112m (2022: £188m) relating to third party interest in consolidated funds and non-controlling interests – ordinary shares to which the shareholder is not exposed.

Exposures to equity risk are primarily managed though the hedging of market risk in respect of seed capital investments where it is appropriate and efficient to do so. Additionally limits are imposed on the amount of seed capital and co-investment activity that may be undertaken. The Group does not hedge equity risk in relation to its investment in Phoenix.

# (b)(i)(ii) Exposure to interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that arises from exposures to changes in the shape and level of yield curves which could result in losses due to the value of financial assets and liabilities, or the cash flows relating to these, fluctuating by different amounts.

The main financial assets held by the Group which give rise to interest rate risk are debt securities and cash and cash equivalents. The Group is also exposed to interest rate risk on its investments in pooled investment funds where the underlying instruments are exposed to interest rate risk.

Interest rate exposures are managed in line with the Group's risk appetite.

# (b)(i)(iii) Exposure to foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk arises where adverse movements in currency exchange rates impact the value of revenues received from, and the value of assets and liabilities held in, currencies other than UK Sterling. The Group's financial assets are generally held in the local currency of its operational geographic locations. The Group generally does not hedge the currency exposure relating to revenue and expenditure, nor does it hedge translation of overseas profits in the income statement. Where appropriate, the Group may use derivative contracts to reduce or eliminate currency risk arising from individual transactions or seed capital and co-investment activity.

The table below summarises the financial instrument exposure to foreign currency risks in UK Sterling.

|  | | UK Sterling | | Indian Rupee | | Euro | | US Dollar | | Singapore Dollar | | Other currencies | | Total | |

1. The Group has made a presentational change to show Deferred income within Other financial liabilities which is part of Financial liabilities. Refer Note 32.

The Indian Rupee exposure at 31 December 2022 primarily related to the Group's investments in HDFC Life and HDFC Asset Management which were fully disposed of in 2023. Refer Note 11 for further details. Other currencies include assets of £41m (2022: £85m) and liabilities of £nil (2022: £1m) in relation to the fair value of derivatives used to manage currency risk.

On 18 October 2017, the Group issued US dollar subordinated notes with a principal amount of US$750m. The related cash flows expose the Group to foreign currency risk on the principal and coupons payable. The Group manages the foreign exchange risk with a cross-currency swap which is designated as a cash flow hedge.

Non-designated derivatives relate to foreign exchange forward contracts that are not designated as cash flow hedges or net investment hedges and primarily relate to the management of currency risk arising from seed capital and co-investment activity.

In addition to financial instruments analysed above, the principal source of foreign currency risk for shareholders arises from the Group's investments in overseas subsidiaries and associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method. The carrying value of the Group's Chinese joint venture is disclosed in Note 14. The Group does not hedge foreign currency risk in relation to these investments.

# (b)(ii) Sensitivity of financial instruments to market risk analysis
The Group's profit/loss after tax and equity are sensitive to variations in respect of the Group's market risk exposures and a sensitivity analysis is presented below. The analysis has been performed by calculating the sensitivity of profit after tax and equity to changes in equity security prices (equity risk), changes in interest rates (interest rate risk) and changes in foreign exchange rate (foreign currency risk) as at the reporting date applied to assets and liabilities other than those classified as held for sale, and after allowing for the Group's hedging strategy.

The variables used in the sensitivity analysis are considered reasonable assumptions and are consistent with market peers. Changes to variables are provided by internal specialists who determine what are reasonable assumptions.

## Profit/loss after tax and equity sensitivity to market risk

| | 31 December 2023 | | 31 December 2022 | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | A reasonable change in the variable within the next calendar year | Increase/(decrease) in post-tax profit | A reasonable change in the variable within the next calendar year | Increase/(decrease) in post-tax profit |
| | % | £m | % | £m |
| Equity prices | | | | |
| Increase | 10 | 74 | 10 | 148 |
| Decrease | 10 | (74) | 10 | (148) |

| Euro against Sterling | | | | |
| Strengthen | 10 | 10 | 10 | 11 |
| Weaken | 10 | (8) | 10 | (9) |

The reasonable change in variables have no impact on any other components of equity. These sensitivities concern only the impact on financial instruments and exclude indirect impacts of the variable on fee income and certain costs which may be affected by the changes in market conditions.

Interest rate sensitivity to a reasonable change in the variable within the next calendar year is not material in either 2023 or 2022.

### Limitations
The sensitivity of the Group's profit after tax and equity may be non-linear and larger or smaller impacts should not be derived from these results. The sensitivities provided illustrate the impact of a reasonably possible change in a single sensitivity factor, while the other sensitivity factors remain unchanged. Correlations between the different risks and/or other factors may mean that experience would differ from that expected if more than one risk event occurred simultaneously.

### (c) Credit risk
Exposures to credit risk and concentrations of credit risk are managed by setting exposure limits for different types of financial instruments and counterparties. The limits are established using the following controls:

| Financial instrument with credit risk exposure | Control |
|---|---|
| Cash and cash equivalents | Maximum counterparty exposure limits are set with reference to internal credit assessments. |
| Derivative financial instruments | Maximum counterparty exposure limits, net of collateral, are set with reference to internal credit assessments. The forms of collateral that may be accepted are also specified and minimum transfer amounts in respect of collateral transfers are documented. |
| Debt securities | The Group's policy is to set exposure limits by name of issuer, sector and credit rating. |
| Other financial instruments | Appropriate limits are set for other financial instruments to which the Group may have exposure at certain times. |

Group Treasury perform central monitoring of exposures against limits and are responsible for the escalation of any limit breaches to the Chief Risk Officer.

Expected credit losses (ECL) are calculated on financial assets which are measured at amortised cost.

Financial assets attract an ECL allowance equal to either:

| | |
|---|---|
| 12 month ECL (losses resulting from possible default within the next 12 months) | No significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.<br>Trade receivables or contract assets with significant financing component, or lease receivables if lifetime ECL measurement has not been elected. |
| Lifetime ECL (losses resulting from possible defaults over the remaining life of the financial asset) | Significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.<br>Trade receivables or contract assets with no significant financing component.<br>Trade receivables or contract assets with significant financing component, or lease receivables for which lifetime ECL measurement has been elected. |
| Changes in Lifetime ECL | Credit-impaired at initial recognition. |

In determining whether a default has taken place, or where there is an increased risk of a default, a number of factors are taken into account including a deterioration in the credit quality of a counterparty, the number of days that a payment is past due, and specific events which could impact a counterparty's ability to pay.

238 | abrdn.com | Annual report 2023

---

The Group assumes that a significant increase in credit risk has arisen when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due. The Group assumes that credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the financial instrument is determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date. Financial instruments with an external rating of 'investment grade' are presumed to have low credit risk in the absence of evidence to the contrary. Investment grade financial instruments are financial assets with credit ratings assigned by external rating agencies with classification within the range of AAA to BBB. If a financial asset is not rated by an external agency it is classified as 'not rated'.

The Group applies the simplified approach, as permitted under IFRS 9, to calculate the ECL allowance for trade receivables and contract assets including accrued income from contracts with customers and lease receivables. Under the simplified approach, the ECL allowance is calculated over the remaining life of the asset, using a provision matrix approach based on historic observed default rates adjusted for knowledge of specific events which could influence loss rates.

At 31 December 2023 the Group does not hold significant financial assets at amortised cost that it regards as credit-impaired or for which it considers the probability of default would result in material expected credit losses in its Investments and Adviser segments. Historically, default levels have been insignificant for the Group's customers within these segments. Trade debtors past due but not in default at 31 December 2023 for these segments were £71m (2022: £84m) of which £36m was over 90 days past due (2022: £33m). We have not identified significant credit risk with counterparties with balances over 90 days past due and recovery is still expected. Consequently, the expected credit losses recognised were less than £1m (2022: less than £1m). In making this assessment the Group has considered if any evidence is available to indicate the occurrence of an event which would result in a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of these assets.

The Group is exposed to a higher level of credit risk within its ii segment (previously named Personal), primarily in relation to ii. Trade debtors past due for the ii segment at 31 December 2023 were £5m (2022: £5m), the majority of which were considered to be credit impaired. A lifetime loss allowance of £2m (2022: £3m) has been recognised based on expected recovery.

(c)(i) Credit exposure
The following table presents an analysis of the credit quality of shareholder financial assets and the maximum exposure to credit risk without taking into account any collateral held.

| Carrying amount | 702 | 588 | 41 | 85 | 1,905 | 1,759 | 450 | 460 | 3,098 | 2,892 |

1. As noted in Section (c) above, Lifetime ECL balances include trade debtors with a gross carrying value of £5m (2022: £5m) which are credit impaired for which a loss allowance of £2m (2022: £3m) has been recognised. All other Lifetime ECL balances are not credit impaired.

In the table above debt securities exclude debt securities relating to third party interests in consolidated funds of £51m (2022: £42m). Cash and cash equivalents exclude cash and cash equivalents relating to third party interests in consolidated funds of £26m (2022: £12m). The shareholder is not exposed to the credit risk in respect of third party interests in consolidated funds since the financial risk of the assets are borne by third parties.

(c)(ii) Collateral accepted and pledged in respect of financial instruments
Collateral in respect of bilateral over-the-counter (OTC) derivative financial instruments and bilateral repurchase agreements is accepted from and provided to certain market counterparties to mitigate counterparty risk in the event of default. The use of collateral in respect of these instruments is governed by formal bilateral agreements between the parties. For OTC derivatives the amount of collateral required by either party is determined by the daily bilateral OTC exposure calculations in accordance with these agreements and collateral is moved on a daily basis to ensure there is full collateralisation. Under the terms of these agreements, collateral is posted with the ownership captured under title transfer of the contract. With regard to either collateral pledged or accepted, the Group may request the return of, or be required to return, collateral to the extent it differs from that required under the daily bilateral OTC exposure calculations.

Where there is an event of default under the terms of the agreements, any collateral balances will be included in the close-out calculation of net counterparty exposure. At 31 December 2023, the Group had pledged £19m (2022: £14m) of cash and £nil (2022: £nil) of securities as collateral for derivative financial liabilities. At 31 December 2023, the Group had accepted £40m (2022: £109m) of cash and £35m (2022: £nil) of securities as collateral for derivatives financial assets and reverse repurchase agreements. None of the securities were sold or repledged at the year end.

(c)(iii) Offsetting financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported on the consolidated statement of financial position only when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

The Group does not offset financial assets and liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial position, as there are no unconditional rights to set off. Consequently, the gross amount of other financial instruments presented on the consolidated statement of financial position is the net amount. The Group's bilateral OTC derivatives are all subject to an International Swaps and Derivative Association (ISDA) master agreement. ISDA master agreements and reverse repurchase agreements entered into by the Group are considered master netting agreements as they provide a right of set off that is enforceable only in the event of default, insolvency, or bankruptcy.

The Group does not hold any other financial instruments which are subject to master netting agreements or similar arrangements.

The following table presents the effect of master netting agreements and similar arrangements.

| | Gross amounts of financial instruments as presented on the consolidated statement of financial position | | Financial instruments | | Financial collateral pledged/(received) | | Net position | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | 2023 £m | 2022 £m | 2023 £m | 2022 £m | 2023 £m | 2022 £m | 2023 £m | 2022 £m |
| **Financial assets** | | | | | | | | |

# (d) Liquidity risk

The shareholder is exposed to liquidity risk if the Group is unable to realise investments and other assets in order to settle its financial obligations when they fall due, or can do so only at excessive cost. The following quantitative liquidity risk disclosures are provided in respect of these financial liabilities.

The Group has a liquidity risk framework and processes in place for monitoring, assessing, and managing liquidity risk.

This framework ensures that liquidity risks are identified across the Group and, where relevant, mitigation measures are put in place. Stress testing of the residual risks is performed to understand the quantum of risk under stress conditions. This then informs the level of liquid resources that need to be maintained. Where appropriate, this is enhanced with external credit facilities and the Group has a syndicated revolving credit facility of £400m which was undrawn at 31 December 2023.

The level of liquid resources in the Group is also projected under a number of adverse scenarios. These are described more fully in the Viability Statement.

A contingency funding plan is maintained to ensure that if liquidity risk did materialise, processes and procedures are already in place to assist with resolving the issue. Regular monitoring of liquid resources is performed and projections undertaken (under both base and stressed conditions) to understand the outlook.

As a result of the policies and processes established to manage risk, the Group expects to be able to manage liquidity risk on an ongoing basis. We recognise there are a number of scenarios that can impact the liquid resources of a business as discussed in the Risk management section of the Strategic report.

## (d)(i) Maturity analysis
The analysis that follows presents the undiscounted cash flows payable under contractual maturity at the reporting date for all financial liabilities, other than those related to unit linked funds which are discussed in Note 23.

| | Within 1 year | | 1-5 years | | 5-10 years | | 10-15 years | | 15-20 years | | Greater than 20 years | | Total | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | 2023 £m | 2022 £m | 2023 £m | 2022 £m | 2023 £m | 2022 £m | 2023 £m | 2022 £m | 2023 £m | 2022 £m | 2023 £m | 2022 £m | 2023 £m | 2022 £m |

1. The Group has made a presentational change to show Deferred income within Other financial liabilities. Refer Note 32.

Refer Note 18 for the maturity profile of undiscounted cash flows of derivative financial instruments.

The Group also had unrecognised commitments in respect of financial instruments as at 31 December 2023 (refer Note 39) with a contractual maturity of within one year, between one and five years and over five years of £2m, £29m and £36m respectively (2022: £3m, £32m and £37m). The commitments may generally be requested anytime up to the contractual maturity.

## 35. Structured entities

A structured entity is an entity that is structured in such a way that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity. The Group has interests in structured entities through investments in a range of investment vehicles including:
– Pooled investment funds managed internally and externally, including OEICs, SICAVs, unit trusts and limited partnerships.
– Debt securitisation vehicles which issue asset-backed securities.

The Group consolidates structured entities which it controls. Where the Group has an investment in, but not control over these types of entities, the investment is classified as an investment in associate when the Group has significant influence. Investments in associates at FVTPL are included in equity securities and pooled investment funds in the analysis of financial investments.

The Group also has interests in structured entities through asset management fees and other fees received from these entities.

### (a) Consolidated structured entities
As at 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022, the Group has not provided any non-contractual financial or other support to any consolidated structured entity and there are no current intentions to do so.

### (b) Unconsolidated structured entities
As at 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022, the Group has not provided any non-contractual financial or other support to any unconsolidated structured entities and there are no current intentions to do so.

The following table shows the carrying value of the Group's interests in unconsolidated structured entities by line item in the consolidated statement of financial position.

|  | 2023 | 2022 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Financial investments |  |  |
| Equity securities and interests in pooled investment funds | 482 | 558 |
| Debt securities | – | – |
| Total financial investments | 482 | 558 |
| Receivables and other financial assets | 196 | 215 |
| Other financial liabilities | 114 | 95 |

The Group's exposure to loss in respect of unconsolidated structured entities is limited to the carrying value of the Group's investment in these entities and the loss of future asset management and other fees received by the Group for the management of these entities. Exposure to loss arising from market and credit risk in relation to investments held in the unit linked funds and relating to third party interest in consolidated funds and non-controlling interests – ordinary shares is not borne by the shareholder.

Additional information on the Group's exposure to financial risk and the management of these risks can be found in Note 23 and Note 34.

The total assets under management of unconsolidated structured entities are £108,993m at 31 December 2023 (2022: £126,019m). The fees recognised in respect of these assets under management during the year to 31 December 2023 were £453m (2022: £566m).

As at 31 December 2023, the Group had no investments in unconsolidated structured debt securitisation vehicles (2022: £nil).

# 36. Fair value of assets and liabilities

The Group uses fair value to measure many of its assets and liabilities. Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable willing parties in an arm's length transaction.

An analysis of the Group's financial assets and financial liabilities in accordance with the categories of financial instrument set out in IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is presented in Notes 17, 23 and 29 and includes those financial assets and liabilities held at fair value.

**(a) Fair value hierarchy**

In determining fair value, the following fair value hierarchy categorisation has been used:

– **Level 1:** Fair values measured using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market exists where transactions take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

– **Level 2:** Fair values measured using inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

– **Level 3:** Fair values measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

Information on the methods and assumptions used to determine fair values for equity securities and interests in pooled investment funds, debt securities and derivatives measured at fair value is given below:

| | Equities and interests in pooled investment funds<sup>1,2</sup> | Debt securities | Derivatives<sup>3</sup> |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Level 1** | Equity instruments listed on a recognised exchange valued using prices sourced from their primary exchange. | Debt securities listed on a recognised exchange valued using prices sourced from their primary exchange. | Exchange traded derivatives valued using prices sourced from the relevant exchange. |
| **Level 2** | Pooled investment funds where daily unit prices are available and reference is made to observable market data. | Debt securities valued using prices received from external pricing providers based on quotes received from a number of market participants.<br><br>Debt securities valued using models and standard valuation formulas based on observable market data<sup>4</sup>. | Over-the-counter derivatives measured using a range of valuation models including discounting future cash flows and option valuation techniques. |
| **Level 3** | These relate primarily to interests in private equity, real estate and infrastructure funds which are valued at net asset value. Underlying real estate and private equity investments are generally valued in accordance with independent professional valuation reports or International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines where relevant. The underlying investments in infrastructure funds are generally valued based on the phase of individual projects forming the overall investment and discounted cash flow techniques based on project earnings.<br><br>Where net asset values are not available at the same date as the reporting date, the latest available valuations are reviewed and, where appropriate, adjustments are made to reflect the estimated impact of changes in market conditions between the date of the valuation and the end of the reporting period.<br><br>Other unlisted equity securities are generally valued using a calibration to the price of a recent investment. | Debt securities valued using prices received from external pricing providers based on a single broker indicative quote.<br><br>Debt securities valued using models and standard valuation formulas based on unobservable market data<sup>4</sup>. | N/A |

1. Investments in associates at FVTPL are valued in the same manner as the Group's equity securities and interests in pooled investment funds.
2. Where pooled investment funds have been seeded and the investment in the funds have been classified as held for sale, the costs to sell are assumed to be negligible. The fair value of pooled investment funds held for sale is calculated as equal to the observable unit price.
3. Non-performance risk arising from the credit risk of each counterparty is also considered on a net exposure basis in line with the Group's risk management policies. At 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022, the residual credit risk is considered immaterial and no credit risk adjustment has been made.
4. If prices are not available from the external pricing providers or are considered to be stale, the Group has established procedures to arrive at an internal assessment of the fair value.

# Group financial statements continued

The fair value of liabilities in respect of third party interest in consolidated funds and non-participating investment contracts are calculated equal to the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities.

Thus, the value of these liabilities is dependent on the methods and assumptions set out above in relation to the underlying assets and liabilities:
– For third party interest in consolidated funds, when the underlying assets and liabilities are valued using readily available market information the liabilities in respect of third party interest in consolidated funds are treated as level 2. Where the underlying assets and liabilities are not valued using readily available market information the liabilities in respect of third party interest in consolidated funds are treated as level 3.
– For non-participating investment contracts, the underlying assets and liabilities are predominately categorised as level 1 or 2 and as such, the inputs into the valuation of the liabilities are observable and these liabilities are predominately categorised within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Where the underlying assets are categorised as level 3, the liabilities are also categorised as level 3.

In addition, contingent consideration assets and contingent consideration liabilities are also categorised as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Contingent consideration assets and liabilities have been recognised in respect of acquisitions and disposals. Generally valuations are based on unobservable assumptions regarding the probability weighted cash flows and, where relevant, discount rate.

(a)(i) Fair value hierarchy for assets measured at fair value in the statement of financial position
The table below presents the Group's non-unit linked assets measured at fair value by level of the fair value hierarchy (refer Note 23 for fair value analysis in relation to assets backing unit linked liabilities).

| | Fair value hierarchy | | | | | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | Total | | Level 1 | | Level 2 | | Level 3 | |
| | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 |

1. Includes £557m (2022: £634m) for the Group's listed equity investment in Phoenix which is classified as a significant listed investment. The Group's listed equity investments in HDFC Asset Management and HDFC Life which were also classified as significant listed investments were sold in the year ended 31 December 2023 (HDFC Asset Management: 2022: £477m, HDFC Life: 2022: £203m).

There were no significant transfers from level 1 to level 2 during the year ended 31 December 2023 (2022: none). There were also no significant transfers from level 2 to level 1 during the year ended 31 December 2023 (2022: none). Transfers generally relate to assets where changes in the frequency of observable market transactions resulted in a change in whether the market was considered active and are deemed to have occurred at the end of the calendar quarter in which they arose.

1. Liabilities in respect of third party interest in consolidated funds at 31 December 2022 were previously all disclosed as Level 2 (£242m). £74m of the liability at this date has been represented in the table above as Level 3 to be consistent with the categorisation of the underlying assets.
2. Excluding contingent consideration liabilities.

There were no significant transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the year (2022: none). Refer Section (a)(iii) below for details of movements in level 3. Transfers are deemed to have occurred at the end of the calendar quarter in which they arose.

# (a)(iii) Reconciliation of movements in level 3 instruments
The movements during the year of level 3 assets and liabilities held at fair value, excluding unit linked assets and liabilities and assets and liabilities held for sale, are analysed below.

1. Excluding contingent consideration liabilities.

For the year ended 31 December 2023, gains of £19m (2022: gains of £24m) were recognised in the consolidated income statement in respect of non-unit linked assets and liabilities held at fair value classified as level 3 at the year end, excluding assets and liabilities held for sale. Of this amount, gains of £19m (2022: gains of £24m) were recognised in Net gains or losses on financial instruments and other income.

Transfers of equity securities and interests in pooled investment funds and debt securities into level 3 generally arise when external pricing providers stop providing a price or where the price provided is considered stale. Transfers of equity securities and interests in pooled investment funds and debt securities out of level 3 arise when acceptable prices become available from external pricing providers.

(a)(iv) Significant unobservable inputs in level 3 instrument valuations
The table below identifies the significant unobservable inputs in relation to equity securities and interests in pooled investment funds categorised as level 3 instruments at 31 December 2023 with a fair value of £233m (2022: £231m).

| | Fair value | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | 2023 £m | 2022 £m | Valuation technique | Unobservable input | Range (weighted average) |
| Private equity, real estate, hedge and infrastructure funds | 221 | 219 | Net asset value | Net asset value statements provided for a large number of funds including nine significant funds (fair value >£5m). | A range of unobservable inputs is not applicable as we have determined that the reported NAV represents fair value at the end of the reporting period. |
| Other unlisted equity securities | 12 | 12 | Indicative share price | Calibration to the price of a recent investment. | A range of unobservable inputs is not applicable as we have determined that the calibration to the price of a recent investment represents fair value at the end of the reporting period. |

The unobservable input for the Group's related liabilities in respect of third party interest in consolidated funds categorised as level 3 instruments at 31 December 2023 with a fair value of (£70m) (2022: (£74m)) are the same as for the private equity, real estate, hedge and infrastructure funds above. There are no single significant funds in relation to liabilities in respect of third party interest in consolidated funds.

The table below identifies the significant unobservable inputs in relation to contingent consideration assets and liabilities and other financial instrument liabilities categorised as level 3 instruments at 31 December 2023 with a fair value of (£118m) (2022: (£124m)).

| | Fair value | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | 2023 £m | 2022 £m | Valuation technique | Unobservable input | Input used |
| Contingent consideration assets and liabilities and other financial instrument liabilities | (118) | (124) | Probability weighted cash flow and where applicable discount rates | Unobservable inputs relate to probability weighted cash flows and, where relevant, discount rates. The most significant unobservable inputs relate to assumptions used to value the contingent consideration liability related to the acquisition of Tritax of £90m (2022: £112m). For Tritax a number of scenarios were prepared, around a base case, with probabilities assigned to each scenario (based on an assessment of the likelihood of each scenario). The value of the contingent consideration was determined for each scenario, and these were then probability weighted, with this probability weighted valuation then discounted from the payment date to the balance sheet date. It was assumed that the timing of the exercise of the earn out put options between 2024, 2025 and 2026 would be that which is most beneficial to the holders of the put options. | The base scenario for Tritax contingent consideration used a revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 31 March 2023 to 31 March 2026 of 9% (2022: CAGR from 31 March 2022 to 31 March 2026 of 14%) with other scenarios using a range of revenue growth rates around this base. The base scenario used a cost/income ratio of c56% (2022: c52%) with other scenarios using a range of cost/income ratios around this base. The risk adjusted contingent consideration cash flows have been discounted using a primary discount rate of 4% (2022: 4.5%). |

(a)(v) Sensitivity of the fair value of level 3 instruments to changes in key assumptions
At 31 December 2023 the shareholder is directly exposed to movements in the value of all non-unit linked level 3 instruments. See Note 23 for unit linked level 3 instruments.

Sensitivities for material level 3 assets and liabilities are provided below. Changing unobservable inputs in the measurement of the fair value of the other level 3 financial assets and financial liabilities to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would not have a material impact on loss attributable to equity holders or on total assets.

246 | abrdn.com | Annual report 2023

---

(a)(v)(i) Equity securities and interests in pooled investment funds/ liabilities in respect of third party interest in consolidated funds
As noted above, of the level 3 equity securities and interests in pooled investment funds, £221m relates to private equity, real estate, hedge and infrastructure funds (2022: £219m) which are valued using net asset value statements. A 10% increase or decrease in the net asset value of these investments would increase or decrease the fair value of the investments by £22m (2022: £22m).

(a)(v)(ii) Liabilities in respect of third party interest in consolidated funds
As noted above, £70m of liabilities in respect of third party interest in consolidated funds of the level 3 equity securities and interests in pooled investment funds (2022: £74m) are also valued using net asset value statements. A 10% increase or decrease in the net asset value of these investments would increase or decrease the fair value of the liability by £7m (2022: £7m).

(a)(v)(iii) Contingent consideration assets and liabilities and other financial instrument liabilities
As noted above, the most significant unobservable inputs for level 3 instruments relate to assumptions used to value the contingent consideration related to the purchase of Tritax. Sensitivities for reasonably possible changes to key assumptions are provided in the table below.

| Assumption | Change in assumption | Consequential increase/(decrease) in contingent consideration liability |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | 2023 £m |
| Revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 31 March 2023 to 31 March 2026 | Decreased by 5% | (17) |
|  | Increased by 10% | 34 |
| Cost/income ratio | Decreased by 5% | 14 |
|  | Increased by 5% | (15) |
| Discount rate | Decreased by 2% | 4 |
|  | Increased by 2% | (4) |

(b) Assets and liabilities not carried at fair value
The table below presents estimated fair values by level of the fair value hierarchy of non-unit linked financial assets and liabilities whose carrying value does not approximate fair value. Fair values of assets and liabilities are based on observable market inputs where available, or are estimated using other valuation techniques.

| | | As recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position line item | | Fair value | | | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 | Level 1 | | Level 2 | | Level 3 | |
| | Notes | £m | £m | £m | £m | 2023 £m | 2022 £m | 2023 £m | 2022 £m | 2023 £m | 2022 £m |

| Debt securities | | 125 | 210 | 125 | 211 | – | - | 125 | 210 | – | 1 |
| Liabilities | | | | | | | | | | | |
| Subordinated liabilities | 30 | 599 | 621 | 534 | 550 | – | – | 534 | 550 | – | – |

The estimated fair values for subordinated liabilities are based on the quoted market offer price.

The carrying value of all other financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost approximates their fair value.

## 37. Statement of cash flows

The Group classifies cash flows in the consolidated statement of cash flows as arising from operating, investing or financing activities.

Cash flows are classified based on the nature of the activity to which they relate and with consideration to generally accepted presentation adopted by peers. For activities related to asset management business, cash flows arising from the sale and purchase of debt securities and equity securities and interests in pooled investment funds, with the exception of those related to unit linked funds, are classified as cash flows arising from investing activities. For activities related to insurance business, including those related to unit linked funds, cash flows arising from the sale and purchase of debt securities and equity securities and interests in pooled investment funds are classified as cash flows arising from operating activities.

For activities related to the acquisition and disposal of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, cash flows are classified as investing activities. The settlement of contingent and deferred amounts recognised on acquisitions and disposals are classified as investing activities where there is not considered to be a significant financing component of the related inflows or outflows.

Purchases and sales of financial investments are presented on a gross basis except for purchases and sales of short-term instruments with a high turnover held in consolidated liquidity funds which are presented on a net basis.

Dividends received from associates and joint ventures are presented as cash flows arising from operating activities.

Movements in cash collateral held in relation to derivative contracts hedging subordinated debt are presented as cash flows arising from financing activities.

The tables below provide further analysis of the balances in the consolidated statement of cash flows.

## 38. Contingent liabilities and contingent assets

Contingent liabilities are possible obligations of the Group of which timing and amount are subject to significant uncertainty. Contingent liabilities are not recognised on the consolidated statement of financial position but are disclosed, unless they are considered remote. If such an obligation becomes probable and the amount can be measured reliably it is no longer considered contingent and is recognised as a liability.

Conversely, contingent assets are possible benefits to the Group. Contingent assets are only disclosed if it is probable that the Group will receive the benefit. If such a benefit becomes virtually certain it is no longer considered contingent and is recognised as an asset.

### Legal proceedings, complaints and regulations
The Group is subject to regulation in all of the territories in which it operates investment management and insurance businesses. In the UK, where the Group primarily operates, the FCA has broad powers, including powers to investigate marketing and sales practices.

The Group, like other financial organisations, is subject to legal proceedings, complaints and regulatory and tax authority discussions and reviews in the normal course of its business. All such material matters are periodically reassessed, with the assistance of external professional advisers where appropriate, to determine the likelihood of the Group incurring a liability. Where it is concluded that it is more likely than not that a material outflow will be made a provision is established based on management's best estimate of the amount that will be payable. A subsidiary of the Group is currently responding to certain information requests from an overseas Tax Authority in connection with its Income Tax Return. Interpretation of tax legislation is complex and therefore, as part of the normal course of business, local tax authorities may sometimes request further information in order to clarify facts and technical approach. These types of enquiries can sometimes be prolonged due to inherent complexity. At this stage of enquiry, it is not possible to reliably predict the outcome.

There are no other identified contingent liabilities expected to lead to a material exposure.

# 39. Commitments

The Group has contractual commitments which will be payable in future periods. These commitments are not recognised on the Group's statement of financial position at the year end but are disclosed to give an indication of the Group's future committed cash flows.

## (a) Unrecognised financial instruments
As at 31 December 2023, the Group has committed to investing an additional £67m (2022: £72m) into funds in which it holds a co-investment interest.

## (b) Capital commitments
As at 31 December 2023, the Group has no capital commitments other than in relation to financial instruments (2022: £2m).

In addition, the Group has commitments relating to future acquisitions.
- In February 2021, the Group announced the purchase of certain products in the Phoenix Group's savings business offered through abrdn's Wrap platform, comprising a self-invested pension plan (SIPP) and an onshore bond product, together with the Phoenix Group's trustee investment plan (TIP) business for UK pension scheme clients. The transaction is not expected to fully complete before 2025 and is subject to regulatory and court approvals. The upfront consideration paid by the Group in February 2021 was £62.5m, which is offset in part by payments from Phoenix to the Group relating to profits of the products prior to completion of the legal transfer. The net amount of consideration paid is included in prepayments in the consolidated statement of financial position with cash movements in relation to the consideration included in prepayment in respect of potential acquisition of customer contracts in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
- At 31 December 2023, the Group had other commitments for the cost of obtaining customer contracts for £22m. These commitments are still subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.

## 40. Employee share-based payments and deferred fund awards

The Group operates share incentive plans for its employees. These generally take the form of an award of options, conditional awards or restricted shares in abrdn plc (equity-settled share-based payments) but can also take the form of a cash award based on the share price of abrdn plc (cash-settled share-based payments). The Group also incentivises certain employees through the award of units in Group managed funds (deferred fund awards) which are cash-settled. All the Group's incentive plans have conditions attached before the employee becomes entitled to the award. These can be performance and/or service conditions (vesting conditions) or the requirement of employees to save in the save-as-you-earn scheme (non-vesting condition). The period over which all vesting conditions are satisfied is the vesting period and the awards vest at the end of this period.

For all share-based payments, services received for the incentive granted are measured at fair value.

For equity-settled share-based payment transactions, the fair value of services received is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. The fair value of the number of instruments expected to vest is charged to the income statement over the vesting period with a corresponding credit to the equity compensation reserve in equity.

At each period end the Group reassesses the number of equity instruments expected to vest and recognises any difference between the revised and original estimate in the consolidated income statement with a corresponding adjustment to the equity compensation reserve.

At the time the equity instruments vest, the amount recognised in the equity compensation reserve in respect of those equity instruments is transferred to retained earnings.

For cash-settled share-based payment and deferred fund awards transactions, services received are measured at the fair value of the liability. The fair value of the liability is remeasured at each reporting date and any changes in fair value are recognised in the consolidated income statement.

The following plans made awards during the year ended 31 December 2023:

| Plan | Options | Conditional awards | Restricted shares | Typical vesting period (years) | Contractual life for options | Recipients | Conditions which must be met prior to vesting |
|------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------|
| abrdn plc Deferred Share Plan/ Discretionary Share Plan/Executive LTIP Plan¹ | Yes | Yes | No | 1-3 years (3 years for Executive LTIP) | Up to 10 years from date of grant | Executives and senior management | Service, or service and performance conditions. These can be tailored to the individual award. |
| Sharesave (Save-as-you-earn) | Yes | No | No | 3 or 5 | Up to six months after vesting | UK and Irish employees | Service only |
| Share incentive plan | No | No | Yes | 3 years | Not applicable | UK and Irish employees | Service only |

¹ Included in Deferred and discretionary share plans in Section (b)(i) below.

All of the awards made under these plans are equity-settled except for a small number of cash-settled awards for the deferred and discretionary share plans (see Section (d)(ii) below).

The fair value of awards granted under the Group's incentive schemes is determined using a relevant valuation technique, such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of awards is recharged to employing entities over the life of the awards.

The awards made under the deferred and discretionary share plans include awards for deferred bonuses of the prior year. With the exception of the Executive Incentive Plan (EIP) awards, the deferred bonus awards have service conditions of one, two and three years after the date of the award and no outstanding performance conditions. The awards for deferred bonus for executive Directors in 2020 were made under the conditions of the EIP including a performance underpin.

The awards made include the awards for executive Directors under the Executive LTIP plan and certain awards under the deferred and discretionary share plans to senior management with specific performance conditions.

Further details of the EIP and the Executive LTIP are set out in the Directors' remuneration report.

The deferred and discretionary share plans also made a number of deferred fund awards in the year end 31 December 2023 (see Section (d)(i) below).

252 | abrdn.com | Annual report 2023

---

Options and conditional awards are all at nil cost with the exception of Sharesave where eligible employees in the UK and Ireland save a monthly amount from their salaries, over either a three or five year period, which can be used to purchase shares in the Company at a predetermined price.

The share incentive plan allows employees the opportunity to buy up to £1,800 of shares from their salary each year with the Group matching up to £600 per year. The matching shares awarded are granted each month but are restricted for three years (two years for Ireland).

In addition, the Group operates the following plans for which there are outstanding awards but for which no awards were made during the year ended 31 December 2023:

| Plan | Options | Conditional awards | Restricted shares | Typical vesting period (years) | Contractual life for options | Recipients | Conditions which must be met prior to vesting |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Aberdeen Asset Management Deferred Share Plan 2009¹ | Yes | No | No | 1-3 (3-5 for executive management) | Up to 10 years from date of grant | Executives and senior management | Service only. There are no outstanding performance conditions at date of grant. |
| Aberdeen Asset Management USA Deferred Share Award Plan | No | Yes | No | 1-3 (3-5 for executive management) | Not applicable | US based executives and senior management | Service only. There are no outstanding performance conditions at date of grant. |

1. Included in Annual bonus deferred share options Section (b)(i) below.

The Group also operated the following plans for which no awards were made during the year ended 31 December 2023 and for which all outstanding awards were exercised by 31 December 2022:

| Plan | Options | Conditional awards | Restricted shares | Typical vesting period (years) | Contractual life for options | Recipients | Conditions which must be met prior to vesting |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Standard Life Restricted stock plan (RSP) | Yes | No | No | 1-3 | Up to six months after vesting | Executives (other than executive Directors) and senior management | Service, or service and performance conditions. These are tailored to the individual award. |

# 42. Capital management

## (a) Capital and risk management policies and objectives
Managing capital is the ongoing process of determining and maintaining the quantity and quality of capital appropriate for the Group and ensuring capital is deployed in a manner consistent with the expectations of our stakeholders. For these purposes, the Board considers our key stakeholders to be our clients, the providers of capital (our equity holders and holders of our subordinated liabilities) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) as the lead prudential supervisor for the Group.

There are two primary objectives of capital management within the Group. The first objective is to ensure that capital is, and will continue to be, adequate to maintain the required level of financial stability of the Group and hence to provide an appropriate degree of security to our stakeholders. The second objective is to create equity holder value by driving profit attributable to equity holders.

The treasury and capital management policy, which is subject to review at least annually, forms one element of the Group's overall management framework. Most notably, it operates alongside and complements the strategic investment policy and the Group risk policies. Integrating policies in this way enables the Group to have a capital management framework that robustly links the process of capital allocation, value creation and risk management.

Capital requirements are forecast on a periodic basis and assessed against the forecast available capital resources. In addition, rates of return achieved on capital invested are assessed against hurdle rates, which are intended to represent the minimum acceptable return given the risks associated with each investment. Ongoing monitoring of investments is incorporated into the Group's established performance management process. The capital planning process is the responsibility of the Chief Financial Officer. Capital plans are ultimately subject to approval by the Board.

The formal procedures for identifying and assessing risks that could affect the capital position of the Group are described in the Risk management section of the Strategic report. Information on financial instruments risk is also provided in Note 34.

## (b) Regulatory capital
### (b)(i) Regulatory capital framework (unaudited)
The Group is supervised under the Investment Firms Prudential Regime (IFPR). The Group's regulatory capital position under IFPR is determined by consolidating the eligible capital and reserves of the Group (subject to a number of deductions) to derive regulatory capital resources, and comparing this to the Group's regulatory capital requirements.

Stress testing is completed to inform the appropriate level of regulatory capital and liquidity that the Group must hold, with results shared with the FCA at least annually. In addition, the Group monitors a range of capital and liquidity statistics on a daily, monthly or less frequent basis as required. Surplus capital levels are forecast, taking account of projected dividends and investment requirements, to ensure that appropriate levels of capital resources are maintained.

The Group is required to hold capital resources to cover both the Own Funds Requirement and the Own Funds Threshold Requirement described below in complying with the Overall Financial Adequacy Rule.

**Own Funds Requirement**  
The Own Funds Requirement focuses on the Group's permanent minimum capital requirement, its fixed overhead requirement and its K-factor requirement with the own funds requirement being the highest of the three. At 31 December 2023, the Group's indicative Own Funds Requirement was £314m.

**Own Funds Threshold Requirement**  
The Own Funds Threshold Requirement supplements the own funds requirement via the Internal Capital Adequacy and Risk Assessment (ICARA), which is the means by which the Group assesses the level of capital that adequately supports all of the relevant current and future risks in its business, taking into account potential periods of financial stress during the economic cycle as well as a potential wind-down scenario with the own funds threshold requirement being the highest of the two, as per the Overall Financial Adequacy Rule. The results of the Group's ICARA process is subject to periodic review by the FCA under the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP). The first review was conducted in 2023.

Under IFPR the Group fully excludes the value of its holding in significant listed investments from its capital resources. IFPR also includes constraints on the proportion of the minimum capital requirement that can be met by each tier of capital. As a result, approximately £275m of Tier 2 capital, whilst continuing to be reported within the Group's capital resources, is not available to meet the minimum capital requirement.

## 43. Events after the reporting date

On 24 January 2024, the Group announced a new transformation programme targeting an annualised cost reduction of at least £150m by the end of 2025. The bulk of the savings will be in non-staff costs. However, the programme is expected to result in the reduction of approximately 500 roles. To achieve the desired simplification and cost savings, total implementation costs are estimated to be around £150m.

On 14 February 2024, the agreed sale of the Group's interest in Virgin Money UTM to its joint venture partner, Clydesdale Bank, was announced. The interest in Virgin Money UTM does not form part of the Group's reportable segments. The sale is expected to complete in H1 2024. The Group's interest in Virgin Money UTM was classified as held for sale at 31 December 2023 (refer Note 21). The sale is expected to result in an IFRS profit on disposal of interests in joint ventures of approximately £11m.

# 44. Related undertakings

The Companies Act 2006 requires disclosure of certain information about the Group's related undertakings which is set out in this Note. Related undertakings are subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and other significant holdings. In this context significant means either a shareholding greater than or equal to 20% of the nominal value of any class of shares, or a book value greater than 20% of the Group's assets.

The particulars of the Company's related undertakings at 31 December 2023 are listed below. For details of the Group's consolidation policy refer to (b) Basis of consolidation in the Presentation of consolidated financial statements section. Under that policy limited partnerships and limited liability companies in which the Group has no interest but whose general partner or manager is controlled by the Group are not consolidated. However, such limited partnerships are considered to be subsidiaries under Companies Act 2006 and therefore are listed below. Where the Group has no interest in a limited partnership or limited liability company that is considered a related entity, the interest held is disclosed as 0%.

The ability of subsidiaries to transfer cash or other assets within the Group for example through payment of cash dividends is generally restricted only by local laws and regulations, and solvency requirements. Included in equity attributable to equity holders of abrdn plc at 31 December 2023 is £94m (2022: £90m) related to the abrdn Financial Fairness Trust, a subsidiary undertaking of the Group. The assets of the abrdn Financial Fairness Trust are restricted to be used for charitable purposes.

The registered head office of all related undertakings is 1 George Street, Edinburgh, EH2 2LL unless otherwise stated.
