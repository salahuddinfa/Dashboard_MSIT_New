## Note 1.    Accounting principles

### A.    General principles

Nexans (the Company) is a French joint stock corporation (société anonyme) governed by the laws and regulations applicable to commercial companies in France, notably the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce). The Company was formed on January 7, 1994 (under the corporate name Atalec) and its headquarters is at Le Vinci, 4 allée de l'Arche, 92400 Courbevoie, France.

Nexans is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Paris (Compartment A) and forms part of the SBF 120 index.

The Nexans Group produces electrical cables and provides its customers with innovative energy transport solutions and services. The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, rounded to the nearest million. Rounding may in some cases lead to non-material discrepancies in the different totals or year-on-year changes. They were approved by the Board of Directors on February 15, 2023 and will become final after approval at the Shareholders' Meeting, which will take place on May 11, 2023, on first call.

Significant information on the accounting methods used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements is described below. Except where otherwise indicated, these policies have been applied consistently to all the financial years presented.

### BASIS OF PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The consolidated financial statements of the Nexans Group have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union at December 31, 2023.

The Group has applied all standards, interpretations and amendments of mandatory application to fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2023, which were as follows:
• Amendments to IFRS 16 "Rental liabilities in case of sale and leaseback";
• amendments to IAS 1 "Classification of current and non-current liabilities";
• amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 concerning reverse factoring.

These publications had no material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.

In particular, following the recommendation of "Pillar 2" of the OECD leading to the creation of a minimum tax regime for large international organizations, on December 14, 2022 the European Union adopted a directive making this regime effective on January 1, 2023, transposed by France as part of the 2023 Finance law. The "Pillar 2" rules are therefore applicable to all entities effectively controlled by Nexans, whether consolidated or not.

The Group has been subject to the "Pillar 2" rules since January 1, 2023. The consequences of applying the standard are described in Note 11 "Income taxes".

Consolidated financial statements

*The audit procedures were carried out and the Statutory Auditors' report is being issued at the date of the publication.*

## NEW STANDARDS PUBLISHED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE

The IASB has issued the following amendment that has been endorsed by the European Union and is applicable from January 1, 2023:
- amendment to IAS 1: "Non-Convertibility"

The Group does not expect its application of this amendment to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

The IASB has not issued any new standards, amendments or interpretations not yet endorsed by the European Union and potentially applicable to Group.

## ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires Management to exercise its judgment and make estimates and assumptions that could have a material impact on the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.

These assessments are carried out on a regular basis by Management in order to take into account past experience and other factors deemed relevant in view of the economic conditions. In particular, the regulations applicable in the coming years and the foreseeable consequences of the commitments made in favor of carbon neutrality, the forecasts of technological and market developments (raw material costs, changes in customer expectations, etc.) are taken into account and any other change that could have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS.

The main sources of uncertainty relating to estimates are discussed in the notes specific to these items when necessary and relate to the following items:
- the recoverable amount of certain items of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, and determining the groups of cash-generating units (CGU) used for goodwill impairment testing (see Note 1.F.A, Note 1.F.B, Note 1.F.C and Note 8). The Group included in its review of the recoverable amount assumptions related to the consequences of climate change;
- recognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets for unused tax losses (see Note 1.E.F and Note 11.B);
- margins to completion and percentage of completion on long-term contracts (see Note 1.E.A);
- the measurement of pension liabilities and other employee benefits (see Note 1.F.J and Note 24);
- provisions and contingent liabilities (see Note 1.F.K, Note 25 and Note 32);
- the measurement of derivative instruments and their qualification as cash flow hedges (see Note 1.F.N and Note 28);
- cancelable lease terms for real estate leases (see Note 1.F.M).

The estimates and underlying assumptions are based on past experience and other factors considered reasonable under the circumstances. They are reviewed on an ongoing basis. They serve as the basis for determining the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities when such amounts cannot be obtained directly from other sources. Due to the inherent uncertainties of any valuation process, it is possible that actual amounts reported in the Group's future financial statements may differ from the estimates used in these financial statements. The impact of changes in accounting estimates is recognized in the period of the change if it only affects that period or over the period of the change and subsequent periods if they are also affected by the change.

## B. Consolidation methods

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Nexans, the subsidiaries over which Nexans exercises control, and companies accounted for by the equity method (associates).

The financial statements of subsidiaries and associates are prepared for the same period as those of the parent company. Adjustments are made to harmonize any differences in accounting policies that may exist.

Subsidiaries (companies controlled by Nexans) are fully consolidated from the date the Group takes over control through the date on which control is transferred outside the Group. Control is defined as the direct or indirect power to govern the financial and operating policies of a company in order to benefit from its activities.

Other companies over which the Group exercises significant influence are classified as associates and accounted for by the equity method. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group's direct or indirect interest is over 20%.

The type of control or influence exercised by the Group is assessed on a case-by-case basis using the presumptions set out in IFRS 10, IFRS 11, and the revised version of IAS 28. A list of the Group's main subsidiaries and associates is provided in Note 34.

Intra-group balances and transactions, including any intra-group profits, are eliminated in consolidation.

## C. Foreign currency translation methods

The Group's financial statements are presented in euros. Consequently:
- The balance sheets of foreign operations whose functional currency is not the euro are translated into euros at the year-end exchange rate.
- Income statement items of foreign operations are translated at the average annual exchange rate. This exchange rate is considered as approximating the rate applicable to the underlying transactions.
- The resulting exchange differences are included in other comprehensive income under "Currency translation differences". The functional currency of an entity is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. In the majority of cases, this currency corresponds to the local currency.
- Cash flow statement items are also translated at the average annual exchange rate.

# NEXANS 2023 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## 05. Consolidated financial statements

*The audit procedures were carried out and the Statutory Auditors' report is being issued at the date of the publication.*

The Group has applied IAS 29 to Turkey since January 1, 2022, and to Ghana since January 1, 2023.

This standard (IAS 29) requires restatement of the non-monetary items of the assets and liabilities of a country experiencing hyperinflation as well as its income statement to reflect the change in the general purchasing power of its functional currency, resulting in a profit or loss on the net monetary position which is recognized in net income. In addition, the financial statements of this country are translated at the closing rate for the period in question.

The consequences of the application of IAS 29 are described in Note 8 "Other financial income and expenses".

IAS 29 has not been applied to translate the financial statements of any other Group company.

Since 2020, the Lebanese economy was considered as hyperinflationary within the meaning of IAS 29. Nevertheless, the functional currency of the Group entity located in Lebanon is the US dollar and its activities in this country are mainly carried out in this currency. As a result, no restatement is made in the Group's financial statement.

Foreign currency transactions are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the transaction date. When these transactions are hedged and the hedge concerned is documented as a qualifying hedging relationship for accounting purposes, the gain or loss on the spot portion of the corresponding derivative directly affects the hedged item, so that the overall transaction is recorded at the hedging rate in the income statement.

In accordance with IAS 21, "The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates", foreign currency monetary items in the balance sheet are translated at the year-end closing rate. Any exchange gains or losses arising on translation are recorded as financial income or expense except if they form part of the net investment in the foreign operation within the meaning of IAS 21, in which case they are recognized directly in other comprehensive income under "Currency translation differences".

Foreign exchange derivatives are measured and recognized in accordance with the principles described in Note 1.F.n.

## D. Business combinations

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method, whereby the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any contingent liabilities are recognized and measured at fair value.

For all business combinations the acquirer must (other than in exceptional cases) recognize any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value (the "full goodwill" method) or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the recognized amounts of the acquiree's identifiable net assets measured at their acquisition-date fair value. In the latter case, no goodwill is recognized on non-controlling interests (the "partial goodwill" method).

Goodwill, determined as of the acquisition date, corresponds to the difference between:
- The aggregate of the acquisition price, generally measured at acquisition-date fair value, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree measured as described above, and for a business combination achieved in stages, the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree; and
- The net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed measured in accordance with IFRS 3.

The Group has a period of 12 months from the acquisition date to complete the initial accounting for a business combination, during which any "measurement period adjustments" may be made. These adjustments are notably made to reflect information obtained subsequent to the acquisition date about facts and circumstances that existed at that date.

The consideration transferred in a business combination must be measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition date fair values of the assets transferred by the acquirer, the liabilities incurred by the acquirer to former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the acquirer. Any contingent consideration at the acquisition date is systematically included in the initial fair value measurement of the consideration transferred in exchange for the acquiree based on probability tests.

Any changes in the fair value of contingent consideration that the acquirer recognizes after the acquisition date and which do not correspond to measurement period adjustments as described above – such as meeting an earnings target different from initial expectations – are accounted for as follows:
- Contingent consideration classified as equity is not remeasured and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
- Contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability that is a financial instrument and is within the scope of IFRS 9 is measured at fair value with any resulting gain or loss recognized in the income statement (notably the effect of unwinding the discount) or in other comprehensive income as appropriate.

The Group accounts for acquisition-related costs for subsidiaries as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services received. However, if the acquisition of a subsidiary is financed through the issuance of equity or debt instruments, the related costs are recognized in equity or debt respectively in accordance with IFRS 9 and IAS 32.

## E. Income statement items

### a. REVENUE

Net sales represent revenue from sales of goods held for resale, as well as sales of goods and services deriving from the Group's main activities, for which consideration has been promised in contracts drawn up with customers. Net sales correspond to the Net sales at current metal prices in Note 4 related to Operating segments.

The Group's main activities correspond to sales of cables produced in its plants, as well as cable installation services. Cables are sold either separately under specific contracts with customers (see below "Sales of goods"), or together with installation services under contracts that combine both sales of cables and installation services (see below "Goods and services contracts").

## 05 Consolidated financial statements

*The audit procedures were carried out and the Statutory Auditors' report is being issued at the date of the publication.*

In accordance with IFRS 15, revenue is recognized under sales when the control of goods or services is transferred to the customer. The amount recognized corresponds to the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for the goods or services.

For all business the sales amount recognized in revenue corresponds to the amount of consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled based on the terms and conditions of each contract and standard commercial practices. Where applicable, penalties are deducted from contract revenue when a risk is estimated and it is likely to be payable. Revenue also includes certain variable consideration, notably relating to discounts and rebates which are measured using the expected value method or based on the single most likely amount depending on the specific terms and conditions of the contracts concerned.

For all of the Group's activities, the revenue recognized as the consideration promised from customers for the transfer of goods or services takes into account the financial impact of payment deferrals when such deferrals are significant and represent a period of more than one year.

### Sales of goods

Customer contracts covering sales of goods include a single performance obligation for each delivery.

Revenue from sales of goods is recognized at a specific point in time, corresponding to the moment when control of the asset concerned is transferred to the customer, which is generally when the goods are delivered.

In addition, as the delivery of goods also corresponds to the moment when the Group obtains an enforceable right to payment, the contra-entry to the recognized amount of sales is presented in "Trade receivables" on the assets side of the consolidated balance sheet.

### Goods and services contracts

Contracts covering both sales of goods and cable installation services essentially concern the Group's high-voltage cable activities. They are contracts that are specifically negotiated for constructing and installing an asset or a group of assets that are closely interrelated or interdependent in terms of their design, technology and function or their ultimate purpose or use. When the customer cannot use an asset or a group of assets during their production or installation due to the specific features of their design and interdependency as provided for contractually, then a single performance obligation is identified per contract.

Performance obligations under goods and services contracts are considered to be satisfied over time if (i) the asset or group of assets created in connection with a goods and services contract is specific to the requirements of the customer and cannot have an alternative use, and (ii) Nexans has an enforceable right to payment for the services performed up until the date in question.

The input method is used to measure progress towards fulfilling the performance obligation based on costs incurred. The costs taken into account do not include any inefficiencies that were not anticipated and cannot therefore trigger any revenue recognition.

For each goods and services contract, the cumulative amount of revenue recognized in respect of all of the Group's service obligations under the contract, less any advance payments received from customers and trade receivables which are recognized separately, is presented in the consolidated balance sheet under "Contract assets" or "Contract liabilities".

Any expected loss to completion is recognized immediately in cost of sales in the consolidated income statement and under "Short-term provisions" or "Long-term provisions" in the consolidated balance sheet.

### Customer advance payments

The Group may receive partial payments from customers before the corresponding work is performed, which are referred to as customer advance payments. In accordance with IFRS 15, these advance payments are recorded under "Contract liabilities" or "Contract assets" depending on the net balance sheet position of the related goods and services contract.

In the same way as for recognition of consideration promised by customers, when recognizing customer advance payments, the Group takes into account the financial impact of payment deferrals when such deferrals are significant and represent a period of more than one year.

### Sales at constant metal prices

On an operating level, the effects of fluctuations in metal prices are passed on in selling prices.

To neutralize the effect of fluctuations in non-ferrous metal prices and thus measure the underlying trend in its business, the Group also presents its sales figures based on a constant price for copper and aluminum. These reference prices were set at 5,000 EUR/ton for copper and 1,200 EUR/ton for aluminum. They are then broken down in the currencies of each unit, thus incorporating the economic conditions specific to the environment of these units. The sales at constant metal prices are shown in Note A.1.

## B. OPERATING MARGIN

Operating margin, a key indicator, measures the Group's operating performance and comprises gross profit (which includes indirect production costs), administrative and selling expenses, and research and development costs (see Note 1.F.a).

Share-based payments (see Note 1.F.i), pension operating costs (see Note 1.F.j) and employee profit-sharing are allocated by function to the appropriate lines in the income statement based on cost accounting principles.

The operating margin is assessed before the effect of (i) the revaluation of the Core Exposure (see Note 1.E.c), (ii) impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill resulting from impairment tests, (iii) changes in fair value of non-ferrous metal derivatives, (iv) capital gains and losses on asset disposals, (v) related acquisition costs for completed acquisitions and expenses and fees related to planned acquisitions, (vi) expenses and provisions for antitrust investigations, (vii) reorganization costs, (viii) of which share in net income of associates, (ix) financial income, (x) taxes, and (xi) net income from discontinued operations.

# NEXANS 2024 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## 05 Consolidated financial statements

*The audit procedures were carried out and the Statutory Auditors' report is being issued at the date of the publication.*

The Group also uses adjusted EBITDA and ROCE as operating performance indicators.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as the operating margin before (i) depreciation, amortization and impairment, (ii) share-based expenses and (iii) certain specific operating items that are not representative of the performance of the Company (see Note 5 for more details). ROCE is the return on capital employed. It is calculated by dividing the operating margin by the capital employed.

C. CORE EXPOSURE EFFECT

This line of the consolidated income statement includes the following two components (see also Note 29.C):

* A price effect: In the Group's IFRS financial statements, non-ferrous metal inventories are measured using the weighted average unit cost method, leading to the recognition of a temporary price difference between the accounting value of the copper used in production and the actual value of this copper as allocated to orders through the hedging mechanism. This difference is exacerbated by the existence on a permanent basis of a minimum inventory of metal that is not hedged (called "Core exposure").

The accounting impact related to this difference is not included in operating margin and instead is accounted for in a separate line of the consolidated income statement called "Core exposure effect". Within operating margin – which is a key performance indicator for Nexans – inventories consumed are valued based on the metal price specific to each order, in line with the Group's policy of hedging the price of the metals contained in the cables sold to customers.

* A volume effect: at the level of operating margin – which is a performance indicator – Core exposure is measured at historic cost, whereas at operating income level it is valued at weighted average cost (see Note 1.F.e) in accordance with IFRS. The impact of any changes in volumes of Core exposure during the period is also recorded under "Core exposure effect" in the consolidated income statement. However, this effect is generally limited as the tonnage of Core exposure is usually kept at a stable level from one period to the next, except for any structural change in the event of structural reorganizations within the Group or following a lasting significant contraction or expansion in business volumes, in accordance with the management principles described in Note 29.C.

D. OPERATING INCOME

Operating income includes operating margin (see Note 1.E.b), Core exposure effect (see Note 1.E.c), reorganization costs (see Note 1.F.k), share in net income of associates and other operating income and expenses. Other operating income and expenses are presented in Note 7 and mainly include impairment losses recorded on property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets following impairment tests (see Note 1.F.c), gains and losses on asset disposals, and expenses and provisions for antitrust investigations.

E. FINANCIAL INCOME AND EXPENSES

Financial income and expenses include the following:

* Cost of debt, net of financial income from investments of cash and cash equivalents.
* Other financial income and expenses, which primarily include foreign currency gains and losses on transactions not qualified as cash flow hedges, additions to and reversals of provisions for impairment in value of financial investments, net interest expense on pensions and other long-term benefit obligations, and dividends received from non-consolidated companies.

Details on the majority of these items are provided in Notes 10 and 26.

F. INCOME TAXES

The income tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred taxes.

Deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences arising between the carrying amount and tax base of assets and liabilities, as well as for tax losses available for carryforward. In accordance with IAS 12, no deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognized for temporary differences resulting from goodwill for which impairment is not deductible for tax purposes, or from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which:

* Is not a business combination,
* At the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit (except in the case of finance leases and actuarial gains or losses on pension benefit obligations),
* Does not give rise, at the time of the transaction, to a taxable temporary difference and a deductible temporary difference of an equal amount.

Deferred tax assets that are not matched by deferred tax liabilities expected to reverse in the same period are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilized, based on medium-term earnings forecasts (generally covering a five-year period) for the company concerned. The Group ensures that the forecasts used for calculating deferred taxes are consistent with those used for impairment testing (see Note 1.F.c).

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled. The rates applied reflect Management's intentions of how the underlying assets will be realized or the liabilities settled. All amounts resulting from changes in tax rates are recorded either in equity or in net income in the year in which the tax rate change is enacted or substantively enacted based on the initial recognition method for the corresponding deferred taxes.

A deferred tax liability is recognized for all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates and interests in joint ventures, except to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if the entity is legally entitled to offset current tax assets and liabilities and if the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority.

*The audit procedures were carried out and the Statutory Auditors' report is being issued at the date of the publication.*

### F. Items recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position

#### A. INTANGIBLE ASSETS

See Notes D and F.c for a description of the Group's accounting treatment of goodwill.

Intangible assets are stated at cost less any accumulated amortization and impairment losses. When they are acquired in a business combination their cost corresponds to their fair value.

The Group applies the cost model for the measurement of intangible assets rather than the allowed alternative method that consists of regularly revaluing categories of assets. Government grants are recognized as a deduction from the gross amount of the assets to which they relate.

Intangible assets primarily correspond to the following:

* Trademarks, customer relationships and certain supply contracts acquired in business combinations. Except in rare cases, trademarks are deemed to have an indefinite useful life. Customer relationships are amortized on a straight-line basis over the period during which the related economic benefits are expected to flow to the Group (between five and 25 years).
* Supply contracts can be deemed to have an indefinite useful life when they are automatically renewable and where there is evidence, notably based on past experience, indicating that the contractual rights will be renewed. Otherwise their useful lives generally correspond to the term of the contract.
* The costs for acquired or developed software, usually intended for internal use, and development costs, to the extent that their cost can be reliably measured and it is probable that they will generate future economic benefits. These assets are amortized by the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives (between three and five years).
* Capitalized development costs that meet the recognition criteria in IAS 38. Capitalized development costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the project concerned from the date the related product is made available. Research costs as well as development costs that do not meet the recognition criteria in IAS 38 are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs to be rebilled to or by customers under the terms of construction contracts are included in "Contract assets" and "Contract liabilities".

Intangible assets are derecognized when the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are transferred.

#### B. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. When they are acquired in a business combination, their cost corresponds to their fair value. In accordance with IAS 23, directly attributable borrowing costs are included in the cost of qualifying assets.

The Group applies the cost model for the measurement of property, plant and equipment rather than the allowed alternative method that consists of regularly revaluing categories of assets. Government grants are recognized as a deduction from the gross amount of the assets to which they relate.

Property, plant and equipment are depreciated by the straight-line method based on the following estimated useful lives:

| Industrial buildings and equipment |  |
|-----------------------------------|-----------|
| Industrial buildings | 20 years |
| Infrastructure and fixtures | 10-20 years |
| Equipment and machinery |  |
| Heavy mechanical components | 30 years |
| Medium mechanical components | 20 years |
| Light mechanical components | 10 years |
| Electrical and electronic components | 10 years |
| Small equipment and tools | 3 years |
| Buildings for administrative and commercial use | 20-40 years |

The depreciation method and periods applied are reviewed at each year-end where necessary. The residual value of the assets is taken into account in the depreciable amount when it is deemed significant. Replacement costs are capitalized to the extent that they satisfy the criteria in IAS 16.

Property, plant and equipment are derecognized when the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are transferred.

Property, plant and equipment also include right-of-use assets recognized for leases (see Note F.m).

#### C. ASSET IMPAIRMENT TESTS

At each period-end the Group assesses whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. Impairment tests are also carried out whenever events or changes in the market environment indicate that property, plant and equipment or intangible assets (including goodwill) may have suffered impairment. An impairment loss is recognized where necessary for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and goodwill are tested for impairment at least once a year.

NEXANS UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024  14

# NEXANS 2024 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Consolidated financial statements

*The audit procedures were carried out and the Statutory Auditors' report is being issued at the date of the publication.*

For operating assets that the Group intends to hold and use in its operations over the long term, the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit (CGU) corresponds to the higher of fair value less costs to sell (where determinable) and value in use. Where the Group has decided to sell particular operations, the carrying amount of the related assets is compared with their fair value less costs to sell. Where negotiations in relation to such a sale are in progress, fair value is determined based on the best estimate of the outcome of the negotiations at the reporting date.

Value in use is calculated on the basis of the future operating cash flows determined in the Group's budget process and strategic plan, which represent Management's best estimate of the economic conditions that will prevail during the remainder of the asset's useful life. The assumptions used are made on the basis of past experience and external sources of information, such as discount rates and perpetual growth rates.

When an analysis of the related context reveals that a CGU, intangible asset or item of property, plant and equipment that is in use or ready for use may have become impaired, the asset concerned is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36, based on the following:

- CGU: a cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. The recoverable amount of goodwill is tested at the level of the CGU or group of CGUs to which it is allocated. The structure of the Group's CGUs is aligned with its operational organization and is based on a combined vision of market segments and geographical areas.

- Other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment: groups of assets with finite useful lives are tested for impairment if there is a specific indication that they may be impaired (as defined in IAS 36). Examples of indications that an asset may be impaired include a pronounced decline in profitability, a considerably lower performance than in the original business plan, or a significant loss of customers, market share or product certifications.

- The discount rate applied corresponds to the expected market rate of return for a similar investment, specific to each geographic area, regardless of the sources of financing. The discount rates used are post-tax rates applied to post-tax cash flows. The recoverable amounts determined using these post-tax rates are the same as those that would be obtained by using pre-tax rates applied to pre-tax cash flows.

- Five-year business plans are used, based on the Group's budget process and strategic plan, with an extrapolation calculated in conjunction with local management for the final years of the projection period if appropriate.

- Operational cash flows are extrapolated based on growth rates specific to each geographical area.

Impairment losses (net of reversals) are recorded in the income statement under "Other operating income and expenses" unless they directly relate to a reorganization operation (see Note F.k.).

## D. FINANCIAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS OR THROUGH OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss or through other comprehensive income relate to the shares in non-consolidated entities. They are initially recognized at fair value. For each of these assets the Group decides whether to measure subsequent changes in fair value either through profit or loss or through other comprehensive income (without any possibility of subsequently being recycled to profit or loss). This choice is made at the initial recognition date and is irreversible.

## E. INVENTORIES AND WORK IN PROGRESS

Inventories and manufacturing work in progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The costs incurred in bringing inventories to their present location and conditions are accounted for as follows:

- Raw materials: purchase cost according to the weighted average cost (WAC) method.

- Finished goods and work in progress: cost of materials and direct labor, and share of indirect production costs, according to the WAC method.

In compliance with IAS 23, qualifying inventories include directly attributable borrowing costs.

Inventories include Core exposure:

- In respect of rod mills, core exposure represents the minimum quantity of non-ferrous metal inventories necessary to establish and maintain continuous operation.

- In respect to Nexans cabling activities, the Core exposure represents the amounts of non-ferrous metals required for the Group's cable plants to operate.

Its overall volume is generally kept stable and is constantly replenished, however the level of Core exposure may have to be adapted at times, particularly in the event of a lasting significant contraction or expansion in business volumes. In the event of structural reorganizations within the Group, the level of Core exposure may have to be revised.

The impact of changes in value of this component is shown in a separate line of the income statement and is included as a component of cash flows from operations in the statement of cash flows.

Net realizable value of inventories is the estimated sale price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated completion costs and the costs necessary to carry out the sale. If the carrying amount of non-ferrous metal inventories is higher than their market value at the year-end, an impairment loss is only recognized when the products to which the assets are allocated have a negative production margin. Additional factors may be taken into account in determining inventory impairment losses, such as obsolescence, physical damage, defects or other indications of impairment (short lengths etc.). As stated in Note E.c., impairment losses on Core exposure are recognized under "Core exposure effect" in the consolidated income statement. Any impairment losses related to other categories of inventories are recognized within operating margin.

### F. TRADE RECEIVABLES AND OTHER RECEIVABLES

Trade receivables are stated at their transaction price determined in accordance with IFRS 15. Interest-free short-term operating receivables are recognized at nominal value as the impact of discounting is not material.

Impairment losses for trade receivables are recognized based on two methods:

- A collective method based on a statistical approach that reflects the expected credit losses over the lifetime of receivables, including receivables not past due, in accordance with IFRS 9.

In order to apply this method, the Group has drawn up a matrix of the rates used to write down its trade receivables that factor in country risks, observed default probabilities and expected losses in the event of default. The base used to calculate these statistical loss allowances also takes into account any contractual guarantees received in relation to the receivables concerned. The carrying amount of the asset is written down and the amount of the loss is recognized in the income statement under "Cost of sales".

- An individual method, whereby an impairment loss is recorded for a trade receivable whenever there is an objective indication that the Group will not be able to collect the full amounts due under the conditions originally provided for at the time of the transaction.

The following are indicators that a receivable may be impaired: major financial difficulties for the debtor, the probability that the debtor will undergo bankruptcy or a financial reorganization, and a payment default. The amount of the impairment loss recorded represents the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and the estimated value of future cash flows discounted at the initial effective interest rate.

Receivables written down by the individual method are excluded from the calculation base for impairment losses determined by the collective method.

In the same way as for the collective method described above, under the individual method, the carrying amount of the asset is written down and the amount of the impairment loss is recognized in the income statement under "Cost of sales".

These impairment methods also apply to "Contract assets" recognized in the consolidated balance sheet.

### G. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash and cash equivalents, whose changes are shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows, comprise the following:

- Cash and cash equivalents, classified as assets in the balance sheet, which include cash on hand, demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

- Bank overdrafts repayable on demand which form an integral part of the entity's cash management. In the consolidated balance sheet, bank overdrafts are recorded as current financial liabilities.

### H. ASSETS HELD FOR SALE

#### Presentation in the consolidated balance sheet
Non-current assets or groups of assets held for sale, as defined by IFRS 5, are presented on a separate line on the assets side of the balance sheet. Liabilities related to groups of assets held for sale are shown on the liabilities side, also on a separate line, except those for which the Group will remain liable after the related sale as a result of the applicable sale terms and conditions. Non-current assets classified as held for sale cease to be depreciated from the date on which they fulfill the classification criteria for assets held for sale.

In accordance with IFRS 5, assets and groups of assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. The potential capital loss arising from this measurement is recognized in the income statement under "Other operating income and expenses" in "Net asset impairment".

#### Presentation in the income statement
A group of assets sold, held for sale or whose operations have been discontinued is a major component of the Group if:

- It represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations;
- It is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operation; or
- It is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.

Where a group of assets sold, held for sale or whose operations have been discontinued is a major component of the Group, it is classified as a discontinued operation and its income and expenses for all periods presented are shown on a separate line of the income statement "Net income (loss) from discontinued operations", which comprises the total of:

- The post-tax profit or loss of discontinued operations, and
- The post-tax gain or loss recognized on the measurement at fair value less costs to sell or on the disposal of assets or groups of assets held for sale constituting the discontinued operation.

When a group of assets previously presented as "held for sale" ceases to satisfy the criteria in IFRS 5, each related asset and liability component – and where appropriate income statement item – is reclassified to the relevant items of the consolidated financial statements.

### I. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS

Stock options, performance shares and free shares may be granted to senior managers and certain other Group employees. These plans correspond to equity-settled share-based payment transactions and are based on the issue of new shares in the parent company (Nexans).

In accordance with IFRS 2 "Share-based Payment", stock options, performance shares and free shares are measured at fair value at the grant date (corresponding to the date on which the plan is announced) up until the end of the subscription period. The value is fixed at the end of the subscription period. The Group uses different measurement models to calculate this fair value, notably the Black & Scholes and Monte-Carlo pricing models.

The fair value of vested stock options, performance shares and free shares is recorded as a payroll expense on a straight-line basis from the grant date to the end of the vesting period, with a corresponding adjustment to equity recorded under "Retained earnings and other reserves".

# NEXANS 2024 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## Consolidated financial statements

*The audit procedures were carried out and the Statutory Auditors' report is being issued at the date of the publication.*

If stock options or share grants are subject to internal performance conditions, their number is updated at the year-end. For plans that are subject to market performance conditions, changes in fair value after the grant date do not affect the amounts recognized in the financial statements.

### J. PENSIONS, STATUTORY RETIREMENT BONUSES AND OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

In accordance with the laws and practices of each country where it operates, the Group provides pensions, early retirement benefits and statutory retirement bonuses.

For basic statutory plans and other defined contribution plans, expenses correspond to contributions made. No provision is recognized as the Group has no payment obligation beyond the contributions due for each accounting period.

For defined benefit plans, provisions are determined as described below and recognized under "Pensions and other long-term employee benefit obligations" in the balance sheet (except for early retirement plans which are deemed to form an integral component of a reorganization plan, see Note 'F.k').

* Provisions are calculated using the projected unit credit method which sees each service period as giving rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement and measures each unit separately to build up the final obligation. These calculations take into account assumptions with respect to mortality, staff turnover, discounting, projections of future salaries and the return on plan assets.
* Plan assets are measured at fair value at the year-end and deducted from the Group's projected benefit obligation.
* In accordance with the revised version of IAS 19, actuarial gains and losses – resulting from experience adjustments and the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions – are recognized as components of other comprehensive income that will not be reclassified to the income statement, and are included in "Changes in fair value and other" within equity.
* The Group analyzes the circumstances in which minimum funding requirements in respect of services already received may give rise to a liability at the year-end.

When the calculation of the net benefit obligation results in an asset for the Group, the recognized amount (which is recorded under "Other non-current assets" in the consolidated balance sheet) cannot exceed the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan, less the present value of any minimum funding requirements.

Provisions for jubilee and other long-service benefits paid during the employees' service period are valued based on actuarial calculations comparable to the calculations used for pension benefit obligations. They are recognized in the consolidated balance sheet under "Pensions and other long-term employee benefit obligations". Actuarial gains and losses on provisions for jubilee benefits are recorded in the income statement.

In the event of an amendment, curtailment or settlement of a defined benefit pension plan, the Group's obligation is remeasured at the date when the plan amendment, curtailment or settlement occurs and the gain or loss on remeasurement is included within operating margin. When a defined benefit pension plan is subject to a reduction in liquidity or an amendment as a result of a reorganization plan, the related impact is presented in "Reorganization costs" in the income statement.

The financial component of the annual expense for pensions and other employee benefits (interest expense after deducting any return on plan assets calculated based on the discount rate applied for determining the benefit obligations) is included in other financial expenses (see Note 9).

### K. PROVISIONS

Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) resulting from a past event when it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits would be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

If the effect of discounting is material, the provisions are determined by discounting expected future cash flows applying a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liabilities concerned. The effect of unwinding the discounting is recognized as a financial expense and the effects of any changes in the discount rate are recognized in the same account as that through which the provision was accrued.

A provision is set aside to fully cover reorganization costs when they relate to an obligation by the Group to another party resulting from a decision made at an appropriate managerial or supervisory level, backed by a detailed formal plan that has been announced before the year-end to the party or parties concerned. Such costs primarily correspond to severance payments, early retirement benefits (except where qualified as employee benefits, see Note 'F.j'), costs for unworked notice periods, training costs of employees whose employment contracts have been terminated, and other costs directly linked to the shutdown of facilities.

Asset retirements and impairment of inventories and other assets as well as other cash outflows directly linked to reorganization measures but which do not meet the criteria for the recognition of a provision are also recorded under reorganization costs in the income statement. In the consolidated balance sheet, this type of impairment is presented as a deduction from the related non-current or current assets. Reorganization costs also include costs directly related to the programs undertaken by the Group transformation strategy.

### L. FINANCIAL LIABILITIES

Financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value, corresponding to their issue price less transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial liability. If the liability is issued at a premium or discount, the premium or discount is amortized over the life of the liability using the effective interest method. The effective interest method calculates the interest rate that is necessary to discount the cash flows associated with the financial liability through maturity to the net carrying amount at initial recognition.

### Convertible bonds and other borrowings

Under IAS 32 "Financial Instruments: Presentation", if a financial instrument has both a liability and an equity component, the issuer must account for these components separately according to their nature.

## 05 Consolidated financial statements

The audit procedures were carried out and the Statutory Auditors' report is being issued at the date of the publication.

This treatment applies, where appropriate, to OCEANE bonds which are convertible into new shares and/or exchangeable for existing shares as the conversion option meets the definition of an equity instrument.

The liability component is measured on the issue date on the basis of contractual future cash flows discounted applying the market rate (taking into account the issuers credit risk) for a similar instrument but which is not convertible/redeemable for shares.

The value of the conversion option is calculated as the difference between the issue price of the bonds and the value of the liability component. This amount is recognized under "Retained earnings and other reserves" in equity.

Following initial measurement of the liability and equity components, the liability component is measured at amortized cost. The interest expense relating to the liability is calculated using the effective interest method.

### Put options given to minority shareholders

Put options given to minority shareholders in subsidiaries are recognized as financial liabilities at their discounted value. The impact of changes in the exercise price of these options is recognized in equity.

### Leases

Leases are recognized in the balance sheet at their inception for an amount corresponding to the present value of the future lease payments. The discount rates used for the present value calculations are based on the Group's incremental borrowing rate to which a spread is added to take into account the economic environments specific to each country.

This amount is recognized under "Lease liabilities" on the liabilities side and "Right-of-use assets" on the assets side. The right-of-use asset recognized for a lease is then depreciated over the term of the lease, which generally corresponds to the non-cancellable period of a lease together with optional periods, i.e. periods where the Group is reasonably certain that it will exercise an extension option or not exercise a termination option.

In the income statement due to the balance sheet treatment referred to above, lease payments are recognized as depreciation of the right-of-use asset included in "Operating margin" and interest on the lease liability included in "Cost of debt (net)". The tax impact of the restatements carried out on consolidation is accounted for via the recognition of deferred taxes.

In the statement of cash flows, lease payments are presented in cash flows from financing activities under "Proceeds from (repayments of) long-term and short-term borrowings" for the portion corresponding to the repayment of lease liabilities and under "Interest paid" for the portion corresponding to the payment of interest on lease liabilities.

Payments under leases corresponding to low value assets or short-term leases are recognized directly as expenses.

### N. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

Only derivatives negotiated with external counterparties are deemed eligible for hedge accounting.

#### Foreign exchange hedges

The Group uses derivatives (mainly forward purchases and sales of foreign currencies) to hedge the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These instruments are measured at fair value, calculated by reference to the forward exchange rates prevailing at the year-end for contracts with similar maturity profiles.

#### Foreign exchange cash flow hedges

When foreign exchange derivatives are used to hedge highly probable future transactions (forecast cash flows or firm orders) that have not yet been invoiced and to the extent that they satisfy the conditions for cash flow hedge accounting, the change in the fair value of the derivative comprises two elements:

- The "effective" portion of the unrealized or realized gain or loss on the hedging instrument, which is recognized directly in equity under "Changes in fair value and other". Any gains or losses previously recognized in equity are reclassified to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item impacts income, for example when the forecast sale takes place. These gains or losses are included in operating margin when they relate to commercial transactions.

- The "ineffective" portion of the realized or unrealized gain or loss, which is recognized directly in the income statement as financial income or expense.

#### Foreign exchange derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting

Changes in fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized directly in the income statement as financial income or expense.

These derivatives notably include instruments used as economic hedges that were never or are no longer designated as hedges for accounting purposes.

#### Hedging of risks associated with fluctuations in non-ferrous metal prices

Forward purchases of non-ferrous metals used in the Group's operations and which require physical delivery of the metals concerned are not included within the scope of IFRS 9. The purchases are recognized on the delivery date.

The Group uses futures contracts negotiated primarily on the London Metal Exchange (LME) to hedge its exposure to non-ferrous metal price fluctuations (copper, aluminum and to a lesser extent, lead). These contracts are settled net in cash and constitute derivative instruments falling within the scope of application of IFRS 9.

*The audit procedures were carried out and the Statutory Auditors' report is being issued at the date of the publication.*

### Cash flow hedges of risks associated with fluctuations in non-ferrous metal prices

Due to the sharp volatility in non-ferrous metal prices over the past several years, the Group has taken measures to enable a large portion of these derivative instruments to be classified as cash flow hedges as defined in IFRS 9. Consequently, whenever these instruments are used to hedge future transactions (mainly purchases of copper wires and cathodes) that are highly probable but not yet invoiced and meet the requirements for cash flow hedge accounting, the Group applies IFRS 9, as follows:

- The "effective" portion of the unrealized gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognized directly in equity under "Changes in fair value and other". The corresponding realized gain or loss is recognized within operating margin.
- The "ineffective" portion of the unrealized gain or loss is recognized in the consolidated income statement under "Other operating income and expenses". The corresponding realized gain or loss is recognized within operating margin, which, in accordance with the Group's management model, includes all of the realized impacts relating to non-ferrous metals.

The scope of entities eligible for hedge accounting covers most of the Group's metal derivatives.

### Hedges of risks associated with fluctuations in non-ferrous metal prices that do not qualify for hedge accounting

Changes in fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized directly within operating income under "Changes in fair value of non-ferrous metal derivatives". Any realized gains or losses are recorded in operating margin when the derivatives expire.

These derivatives notably include instruments used as economic hedges that were never or are no longer designated as hedges for accounting purposes.

### Note 2 - Climate issues

Nexans closely monitors the challenges and potential consequences of climate change on its business strategy and investments.

As detailed in Chapter 3 "Corporate Social Responsibility" Section 3.1, the Group has included the Environment in its E³ performance model. It is designing, developing and selling low-carbon solutions and has set targets for reducing carbon emissions by 2030 and 2050 set on the basis of the Paris Agreement.

In line with the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) rules, Nexans has committed itself to:
- achieve "Net-Zero" emissions by 2050;
- reduce its absolute Scopes 1 & 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 46% and its Scope 3 GHG emissions by 30%, with a baseline year of 2019.

These commitments involve an ambitious approach to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 4.2% per year.

To this end, Nexans has implemented concrete actions such as the development of the circular economy since 2008 through Recycable (Joint Venture with Suez) or through the use, for example, of a new material based on recycled aluminum or by proposing the launch in 2023 of a low-carbon offer of distribution network cables.

The Group has also chosen to invest in a targeted manner in the renovation or purchase of equipment. By making incremental investments, the Group can limit its recurring investments in maintenance and optimization. These investments include, for example, the installation of photovoltaic panels to improve the share of renewable and low-carbon energy while securing its supply.

On the financing side, as part of the Sustainable Financing Framework, the Group carried out its first sustainable development bond issue for an amount of 500 million euros. This fixed-rate issue maturing on April 5, 2028 is linked to the climate objectives that Nexans hope to achieve by December 31, 2030, for the reduction of its Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions, as well as for its Cradle-to-Shelf approach relating to the CO₂ content of Scope 3 emissions products. Failure to comply with any of these obligations would result in an increase in the coupon rate of the last year (see Note 26).

The consequences in terms of investments, costs and other impacts on cash flows are taken into account when preparing accounting estimates. In particular, the impairment tests carried out include the following items:
- the incremental investments related to the commitments made in terms of objectives for the contribution to carbon neutrality are insignificant and have no consequences on the review of the valuation of the Group's assets;
- Forecasts of tensions on the copper market led the Group to include in its sensitivity tests the consequences of a possible reduction in the volume of copper.

It is also possible that in the future the carrying amount of the assets or liabilities recognized in the Group's financial statements will be subject to different impacts as the climate change management strategy evolves or as the consequences of climate change materialize in the form of, for instance, rising sea levels or more frequent and severe droughts.

In this context, Nexans is working to identify the risks on these assets in particular through the completion in 2023 of a study by Axa Climate on the challenges of the physical risks related to climate change for the Group's assets. Alongside the actions and protections already in place, this study enables the Group to determine its exposure and the future action plans to be put in place. The review of the conclusions of this study had no impact on the valuation of the assets in the financial statements. Any future action plans will be included in the assumptions for impairment tests as they are realized.

For more details on the impairment tests, please refer to Note 8.

## Note 2. Significant events of the year

### A. Changes in Group structure

**ACQUISITION OF THE LA TRIVENETA CAVI GROUP**

In early 2024, Nexans entered into an agreement for the acquisition of the La Triveneta Cavi Group, one of the leaders in the medium and low-voltage cable sector.

Founded in Italy in 1965, and now present in 55 countries, La Triveneta Cavi primarily manufactures low-voltage cables for building, infrastructure, fire-retardant cable systems and renewable energy applications. The company operates a best-in-class vertically integrated network with three cable production units featuring highly efficient logistic capabilities in addition to a world class "in-house" copper drawing facility. The company has almost 700 skilled employees and has generated current revenue of more than €405 million euros over the last twelve months.

Nexans successfully completed this acquisition after obtaining the authorization from the Italian competition authority at the end of May 2024.

The details and conditions of this transaction as well as the provisional goodwill are presented in **Note 14**.

The entities of the La Triveneta Cavi Group have been fully consolidated since June 1, 2024 and their activities contributed to the Group's consolidated financial statements for 2024 for revenue at current metal prices of 425 million euros and an operating margin of 35 million euros.

On a 12-month basis, considering, for example, an acquisition made on January 1, 2024, the contribution to the recurring revenue and the operating margin can be estimated at 730 million euros and 41 million euros respectively.

### B. Assets held for sale

As of December 31, 2024, a divestment program is undertaken for the entity Amercable, based in the United States and whose activity concerns resource cables (oil and gas, mines).

The sale has been finalized on January 12, 2025, refer to post-closing events in **Note 15**.

As a result, these items are presented in "Assets and groups of assets held for sale" as of December 31, 2024 in application of IFRS 5, see **Note 13**

The details of this presentation to the Group's accounts are also detailed in this note.

### C. Financing

Nexans issued 2 new bonds during this first semester 2024:
- a first issue, on March 11, 2024, for 350 million euros, with a six-year maturity and an annual interest rate of a 4.25%.
- a second issue on May 17, 2024, for 300 million euros, with a five-year maturity and an annual interest rate of 4.125%. This bond loan partly financed the acquisition of the La Triveneta Cavi Group.

Nexans redeemed the 200 million euros bond on its maturing date of April 5 2024.

## Note 4. Operating segments

Beginning of 2024, the Group announced a change in its organization and in the label of its businesses, without any impact on IFRS 8 segmentation. The Group has thus the following reportable segments within the meaning of IFRS 8 (after taking into account the aggregations authorized by the standard). These segments reflect the managerial organization of the Group and are defined on the basis of products and applications specific to different markets, all geographical areas combined:

- **"PWR-Grid & Connect"** formerly "Buildings & Territories":  
this segment provides reliable cabling systems and smart energy solutions enabling buildings and territories to be more efficient, sustainable and people-friendly. It covers the following markets: building, smart cities/grids, e-mobility, local infrastructure, decentralized energy systems and rural electrification. It has two components:
  - **"PWR-Grid"** (ex-Distribution) which covers the cables intended for the energy distribution networks managed by the electricity suppliers within the territories.
  - **"PWR-Connect"** (ex-Usages) corresponding to all the equipment cables of the various buildings.

- **"PWR-Transmission"** (ex-Generation & Transmission) this segment partners its customers from the start of the cycle (design, engineering, financing, asset management) right through to the end (systems management) to help them find the cabling solution that is the best suited to their needs in terms of efficiency and reliability. It includes the following markets: offshore wind farms, subsea interconnections, onshore high voltage, subsea data transmissions (closely related to high voltage submarine projects), as well as the finalization of ongoing projects for smart solutions for the oil and gas sector.

- **"Industry & Solutions"** this segment provides support to OEMs and industrial infrastructure project managers in personalizing their cabling and connection solutions to enable them being powered and meet their electrification, digitization and automation requirements. It covers the following markets: transport (aeronautics, rail, shipbuilding, automotive), automatic devices, renewable energy (solar and wind power), resources (oil and gas, mining) and other sectors (nuclear, medical, handling).

The Group's segment information also includes a column entitled **"Other"** which corresponds to certain specific or centralized activities carried out for the Group as a whole which give rise to expenses that are not allocated between the various segments and the Electrical Wires business, comprising wire rods, electrical wires and winding wire production operations.

## 05 Consolidated financial statements

*The audit procedures were carried out and the Statutory Auditors' report is is being issued at the date of the publication.*

Thus, among the items that principally contribute to the **"Other"** item, the following facts should be mentioned:
- At December 31, 2023, 83% of the sales at constant metal prices recorded under this segment were generating by the Group's "Electrical Wires" business (compared with 76% in 2022), with the remainder being generated almost entirely by the Telecom/Data residual business.
- the operating margin for "Other Activities" was a 61 million euros at December 31, 2023. It includes the combined impact of profit generated from sales of copper wires and certain centralized Group costs that are not allocated between the segments (such as holding company expenses).

Transfer prices between the various operating segments are generally the same as those applied for transactions with parties outside the Group.

The segments presented in the segment information correspond to product families that are similar in nature, customer type, distribution methods and manufacturing processes.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as the operating margin before (i) depreciation, amortization and provisions, (ii) share-based expenses and (iii) certain other specific operating items that are not representative of the Company's performance.

Revenue at constant metal prices for 2023 and 2024 have been calculated using the reference prices of 5,000 EUR/ton for copper and 1,500 EUR/ton for aluminum. They are then broken down in the currencies of each unit, thus incorporating the economic conditions specific to the environment of these units.

### B. Contract assets and contract liabilities

Contract assets and contract liabilities can be analyzed as follows:

| in millions of euros | December 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | Sales of goods | Goods and services contracts | Sales of goods | Goods and services contracts |
| Contract assets | - | 194 | - | 187 |
| Contract liabilities | (193) | (810) | (130) | (608) |
| TOTAL | (193) | (616) | (130) | (421) |

#### SALES OF GOODS

Contract liabilities correspond to customer advance payments. The related performance obligation is satisfied within two years of receipt of the advance payment. The majority of the amounts reported at December 31, 2023 are included in revenue in 2024.

#### GOODS AND SERVICES CONTRACTS

Among the contract assets and liabilities for goods and services contracts, the assets correspond mainly to revenue recognized in respect of services rendered but not yet invoiced at the period-end. Amounts recorded in "Contract assets" are transferred to "Trade receivables" when the Group obtains an enforceable right to payment.

The liabilities relate to customer advance payments yet to be recognized in revenue as the related performance obligation is satisfied.

The 195 million euros negative change in contract assets and liabilities reflects:
- 120 million euros positive change corresponding to outstanding contract liabilities at December 31, 2023 that were recognized in revenue in 2024.
- 120 million euros negative effect of timing differences between 2024 billings and revenues recognized using the percentage completion method.
- 60 million euros negative change corresponding to outstanding contract assets at December 31, 2023 that were billed in 2024.
- 35 million euros negative change for the net increase in advances received.
- 20 million euros positive change related to differences in foreign currencies values between 2023 and 2024.

### C. Unsatisfied performance obligations

#### SALES OF GOODS

Due to the nature of the business, performance obligations related to sales of goods are satisfied within the short term. Consequently, the amount of the benefits corresponding to unsatisfied performance obligations is not detailed.

#### GOODS AND SERVICES CONTRACTS

Goods and services contracts mainly concern the Group's high-voltage cable and umbilical cable activities. Unsatisfied performance obligations for these activities amount to 3,853 million euros and should be almost entirely satisfied by 2031.

### Note 6. Payroll costs and headcount

Acquisition‑related costs are mainly related to the acquisition in 2024 of the La Triveneta group in Italy, see Note 14.

## Note 8. Net asset impairment

| in millions of euros | 2024 | 2023 |
|----------------------|------|------|
| Impairment losses – non‑current assets | (0) | |
| Reversals of impairment losses – non‑current assets | | 23 |
| Impairment losses – goodwill | | |
| Impairment losses – assets and groups of assets held for sale | | |
| **NET ASSET IMPAIRMENT** | **(0)** | **23** |

The Group carries out impairment tests on goodwill at least once a year, on intangible assets with an indefinite useful life at least once a year, and on other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired (see Note 1.F.c).

The valuation of the Group's goodwill is carried out at the level of the Cash-Generating Units (CGU) to which they are allocated. In the event of an unfavorable difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognized.

Since 2022, the Group has integrated the challenges associated with the consequences of climate change and the commitments taken for the contribution to carbon neutrality in its approach to the review of the valuation of its assets, in particular via the following elements:

• the investments related to the commitments made in terms of objectives for the contribution to carbon neutrality are insignificant and have no consequences on the review of the valuation of the Group's assets.

• the forecasts of tensions on the copper market led the Group to include in its sensitivity tests the consequences of a possible 10% reduction in volume for the P&T‑Connect business within the P&T‑Grid & Connect segment from 2026. The other activities were not subject to a sensitivity test on this point: they are not affected by such a shortage either because they are considered as a strategic activity or because they are not very exposed to a potential reduction in the availability of copper.

• In 2023, the Group also commissioned a study by Axa Climate on the challenges of physical risks related to climate change for the Group's assets. This study identified six sites with high ISO risks regarding climate change. Following this, actions were put in place to reduce the risks identified.

End 2024, like 2023, the Group has not identified any element related to this work that could lead to the recognition of an impairment loss on one of its assets. Any future action plans will be included in the impairment test assumptions as they are realized.

In addition, the Group also associated the challenges of climate change with its last sustainable development bond issue (see Note 26).

### A. Results of the impairment tests performed over the year

As described in Note 1.F.c and in accordance with IAS 36, impairment tests were first carried out on individual assets when an indication of impairment was identified.

As part of the closing of the financial statements at December 31, 2024, the Group conducted a review of the main impairment issues to identify any indications of impairment that appeared during the period both on individual assets and on Cash‑Generating Units (CGU).

Following the identification of indicators linked to the slowdown in the "electromobility" branch within the automotive harness business, and to the economic and geopolitical situation in Lebanon and Ukraine, the Group carried out impairment tests which did not reveal any loss of value to be recognized.

In 2023, the performance improvement of the North America Industry & Solutions CGU and the improvement in the Asia‑Pacific P&T‑Grid & Connect CGU led the Group to record impairment reversals of €7 million and €17 million respectively on intangible assets (customer relations, brands).

| | South America PWR-Grid Connect CGU (a) | Asia-Pacific PWR-Grid Connect CGU (a) | Europe PWR-Grid Connect CGU (a) | Europe Industry and Solutions CGU | Other CGUs | TOTAL |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **DECEMBER 31, 2023** | 104 | 66 | 41 | 31 | 51 | 293 |
| Business combinations | - | - | 201 | - | - | 201 |
| Disposals/acquisitions | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Impairment losses | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Exchange differences and other | 4 | (1) | (0) | (0) | (28) | (25) |
| **DECEMBER 31, 2024** | 108 | 64 | 243 | 31 | 24 | 470 |

(a) "PWR-Grid Connect" is the new denomination of the "Buildings and Territories" segment (cf. Note 4)

The goodwill of the Europe PWR-Grid Connect CGU increased by 201 million euros due to the acquisition of the Group La Triveneta Cavi (see Note 14).

The goodwill of the Other CGUs decreased by 28 million euros due to principally, the presentation of Amercable entity in Assets and groups of assets held for sale (see Note 1).

No impairment loss on goodwill was recognized by the Group in 2024 or 2023.

## C. Key assumptions

The discount rates in the Group's main monetary areas and the perpetuity growth rates applied when preparing the business plans used in connection with impairment testing are presented below by geographic area:

| | Discount rates (after tax) of future flows | | Infinite growth rate | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | **2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023** |
| Europe (Euro Zone) | 8.7% | 9.0% | 1.2% | 1.2% |
| Chile | 11.0% | 11.5% | 2.3% | 2.4% |
| United States of America | 10.0% | 10.3% | 2.1% | 2.1% |
| Brazil | 13.8% | 15.0% | 2.5% | 2.0% |
| China | 10.8% | 11.0% | 3.3% | 3.4% |
| Peru | 12.0% | 12.5% | 2.3% | 3.0% |
| Norway | 9.6% | 10.0% | 1.4% | 1.4% |
| Australia | 10.2% | 10.3% | 2.3% | 2.3% |
| Ukraine | 35.0% | 35.0% | 1.2% | 1.2% |
| Lebanon | 35.0% | 35.0% | 2.7% | 2.7% |

The cash flow assumptions used for impairment calculations were based on the latest projections approved by Group Management and therefore factor in Management's most recent estimates of the Group's future business levels (as contained in the 2025 Budget and the new Strategic Plan). Cash flows are projected over a five-year period for the purpose of these assumptions.

## Sensitivity analyses

The main assumptions described above are used for measuring the CGUs that are tested for impairment. Sensitivity analyses are performed to assess the effect on the calculations of changes in the assumptions. The method used consists of testing the effect of the following changes in assumptions:

- 50-basis point increase in the discount rate compared to the assumptions used.
- 50-basis point decrease in the perpetuity growth rate compared to the assumptions used.
- 50-basis point decrease in EBITDA margin (measure of business performance) compared to the assumptions used.
- 10% reduction in the volume of PWR-Connect business within the PWR-Grid & Connect segment to reflect a potential shortage of copper.

An increase in the discount rate of 50 basis points compared to the assumptions used would lead to a depreciation of 9 million euros on the automotive harness business.

The other sensitivity tests did not reveal any potential need to recognize additional impairment losses.

## Note 9. Net gains (losses) on asset disposals

| in millions of euros | 2024 | 2023 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Net gains (losses) on disposals of fixed assets | (7) | 4 |
| Net gains (losses) on disposals of investments | 2 | (13) |
| Other | | |
| **NET GAINS (LOSSES) ON ASSET DISPOSALS** | **(4)** | **(9)** |

In 2024, the Group recognized a gain on disposals of investments mainly thanks to a profit made in relation with the liquidation of a non-consolidated entity.

In 2023, the Group recognized capital gains (losses) on disposals of 13 million euros which included:
- The sale of the Telecom Systems business for 57 million euros, leading to a net capital loss of EB million. The sale price of 57 million euros was paid in cash for 24 million euros, the balance corresponding to five-year loans, with most of which carrying an interest rate of 12%. The sale price was subject to a non-significant adjustment in 2024.
- The sale contract also includes an "earn-out" clause calculated at 30% of the potential gain from the resale of the business by the purchaser. This clause is capped at 40 million euros.
- The sale of all shares held in the equity-accounted company IES Energy, i.e. 27.8% of the capital. This sale resulted in a net capital loss of 1 million euros.

## Note 10. Other financial income and expenses

| in millions of euros | 2024 | 2023 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Dividends received from non-consolidated companies | 3 | 2 |
| Provisions | (4) | (1) |
| Net foreign exchange gain (loss) | (48) | (10) |
| Net interest expense on pensions and other long-term employee benefit obligations | (6) | (5) |
| Hyperinflation | (2) | (3) |
| Other | (4) | (7) |
| **OTHER FINANCIAL INCOME AND EXPENSES** | **(61)** | **(24)** |

In 2023, the impairment recorded on cash deposits in Lebanon was reversed in full for 1 million euros following the change in the conversion rate used to convert deposits into Lebanese currencies. The balance of these deposits of 3 million euros remains classified in other net receivables excluding cash and cash equivalents (see Notes 21 and 26).

Foreign exchange gains and losses (net) correspond to realized or unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on commercial transactions recorded in the balance sheet or in the backlog. These exchange gains and losses may vary significantly from one year to the next.

### Effects of the application of IAS 29 "Hyperinflation" in Turkey and in Ghana

As indicated in Note 1, the Group applied IAS 29 for its Turkish and Ghanaian subsidiaries and used the indicators published by the IMF to revalue the income statement, cash flows and non-monetary assets and liabilities.

The consequences of the treatment of hyperinflation in the income statement for the fiscal year are reflected in:
- In Turkey, the indicator increased by 44% in the 2024 fiscal year (67% in 2023). The EUR/TRY exchange rate used for the translation of the income statement was 35.73 at December 31, 2024 (33.15 at December 31, 2023).
- In Ghana, the indicator increased by 24% in the 2024 fiscal year (27% in 2023). The EUR/GHC exchange rate used for the translation of the income statement was 15.51 at December 31, 2024 (11.16 at December 31, 2023).
- for the Turkish subsidiary, an increase in consolidated revenue for the period of around 21 million euros (up 13 million euros in 2023), an increase in operating margin of around 4 million euros (increase of 2 million euros in 2023), while other financial income and expenses include an insignificant expense reflecting the consequence of hyperinflation on the net monetary position (expense of 2 million euros in 2023).
- for the Ghanaian subsidiary, an increase in consolidated revenue for the period of around 5 million euros (up 2 million euros in 2023), an insignificant increase in the operating margin, while other financial income and expenses included an expense of 2 million euros reflecting the impact of hyperinflation on the net monetary position (expense of 1 million euros in 2023).

## Note 11. Income taxes

### A. Analysis of the income tax charge

(in millions of euros) | 2024 | 2023
--- | --- | ---
Current income tax charge | (119) | (93)
Deferred income tax (charge)/benefit, net | 4 | 24
**INCOME TAXES** | **(115)** | **(68)**

In 2024, Nexans headed up a tax group in France that comprised 14 companies. Other tax groups have been set up where possible in other countries, including Germany, the United States, Italy and South Korea.

The 2024 income tax charge included a non-material expense below 1 million euro in relation with Pillar II (in line with preparatory work).

### B. Effective income tax rate

The effective income tax rate was as follows:

Tax proof in millions of euros | 2024 | 2023
--- | --- | ---
Income before taxes | 398 | 292
of which share in net income of associates | (0) | 1
**INCOME BEFORE TAXES AND SHARE IN NET INCOME OF ASSOCIATES** | **398** | **290**
Standard tax rate applicable in France (in %)(a) | 25.83% | 25.83%
**THEORETICAL INCOME TAX CHARGE** | **(103)** | **(75)**
Effect of:  |  | 
• Difference between foreign and French tax rates | 2 | (7)
• Change in tax rates for the period | (0) | (0)
• Unrecognized deferred tax assets | (7) | 20
• Taxes calculated on a basis different from "Income before taxes" | (12) | (14)
• Other permanent differences | 5 | 7
**ACTUAL INCOME TAX CHARGE REPORTED** | **(115)** | **(68)**
**EFFECTIVE TAX RATE (in %)** | **28.94%** | **23.57%**

(a) For the purpose of simplicity, the Group has elected to only use the standard tax rate for France i.e. including surtaxes.

The theoretical income tax charge is calculated by applying the parent company's tax rate to consolidated income before taxes and share in net income of associates.

## D. Deferred taxes recognized in the consolidated balance sheet

Deferred taxes break down as follows by type:

| in millions of euros | December 31, 2023 | Impact on income | Impact on equity | Change in consolidation scope | Exchange differences and other | December 31, 2024 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fixed assets | (67) | 6 | - | (54) | 5 | (111) |
| Other assets | (79) | (27) | - | (1) | 4 | (104) |
| Employee benefit obligations | 22 | (0) | (7) | - | 0 | 15 |

| **DEFERRED TAX ASSETS (GROSS) AND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES** | **545** | **4** | **7** | **(52)** | **(1)** | **503** |
| Unrecognized deferred tax assets | (545) | 1 | (0) | - | 8 | (536) |
| **NET DEFERRED TAXES** | **0** | **4** | **7** | **(52)** | **6** | **(33)** |
| ➔ of which recognized deferred tax assets | 129 | - | - | - | - | 117 |
| ➔ of which deferred tax liabilities | 129 | - | - | - | - | 151 |
| **NET DEFERRED TAXES EXCLUDING ACTUARIAL GAINS AND LOSSES** | **(22)** | - | - | - | - | **(48)** |

At December 31, 2024, deferred tax assets in an amount of 536 million euros were not recognized as the Group deemed that their recovery was not sufficiently probable (545 million euros at December 31, 2023). These mainly concern the tax losses described in Note 11.E below.

## E. Unused tax losses

For countries in a net deferred tax asset position after offsetting deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities arising from temporary differences, the net deferred tax asset recognized in the consolidated balance sheet is determined based on updated business plans (see Note 1.E.f).

The line "Unused tax losses, deductible interest and tax credits" (see Note D) consisted of 508 million euros in unused tax losses, 95 million euros in non‑deductible interest and 19 million euros in tax credits at December 31, 2024.

Unused tax losses carried forward represented potential tax benefits for the Group of 508 million euros at December 31, 2024 (532 million euros at December 31, 2023). The main entities concerned are:

• French subsidiaries, in an amount of 271 million euros (254 million euros at December 31, 2023), of which 9 million euros were recognized in deferred tax assets at December 31, 2024 (8 million euros at December 31, 2023).

• German subsidiaries, in an amount of 179 million euros (184 million euros at December 31, 2023), of which 30 million euros were recognized in deferred tax assets at December 31, 2024 (26 million euros at December 31, 2023).

Deferred tax assets recognized in France and Germany are consistent with the Group's analysis based on the latest business plans and the reorganization measures implemented in the subsidiaries concerned.

(a) The tax effects relating to cash flow hedges as well as the gains and losses generated during the year and amounts recycled to the income statement are presented in the consolidated statement of changes in equity in the "Changes in fair value and other" column.
(b) These taxes will be recycled to the income statement in the same periods as the underlying transactions to which they relate (see Notes 1.C and F.N).

## Note 13.    Assets held for sale and discontinued operations

In November 2023, the Group entered into an sale agreement for AmerCable entity, a North American power instrumentation and control cable entity in the resources sector (oil and gas, mining) to Mattb based on a value of 140 million US dollar.

With its completion expected within the next twelve months, this program meets the criteria for Assets held for sale within the meaning of IFRS 5.

As a result, the balance sheet contribution of the Amercable entity is presented in Assets and asset groups held for sale as of December 31, (states in euro).

December 31, 2024: 
Its activities are presented in the "Industry & Solutions" section of the segment reporting, and contribute 256 million euros to net sales at current metal prices and 21 million euros to adjusted EBITDA in 2024.

In accordance with IFRS 5, the Group has valued these asset groups at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs, without recognition of an impairment loss for the disposal.

| (At December 31, in millions of euros) | 2024 |
|---------------------------------------|------|
| Net property, plant and equipment and intangible assets | 79 |
| Inventories and work in progress | 38 |

| TOTAL ASSETS AND GROUPS OF ASSETS HELD FOR SALE | 131 |
| Trade payables | (12) |
| Other liabilities | (18) |
| LIABILITIES RELATED TO GROUPS OF ASSETS HELD FOR SALE | (29) |

As of December 31, 2024, the conversion reserves related to these entities represent a loss of 25 million euros.
The sale of Amercable was finalized on January 2, 2025, see Note 30.

## Note 14.    Goodwill

The evolution of goodwill in 2024 (490 million euros at December 31, 2024, versus 294 million euros at December 31, 2023) was primarily attributable to the acquisition of the groupe La Triveneta Cavi and to a lesser extent to changes in exchange rates over the period as several of the Group's goodwill items are expressed in foreign currencies as they relate to the Australian (Olex), South American (Madeco, Centelsa) and North American (AmerCable) acquisitions.

All goodwill are tested for impairment as soon as there is an indication of impairment and at least once a year according to the methods and assumptions described in Note 7. No impairment was recognized under goodwill at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

### Goodwill associated with the acquisition of the La Triveneta Cavi Group

The acquisition was paid mainly by proceeds of the bonds issued in May 2024, for an acquisition cost of the shares of 577 million euros.

The amount paid net of the cash acquired amounted to 514 million euros at December 31, 2024.

The provisional goodwill recognized before allocation to identifiable assets and liabilities amounted to 334 million euros on the date of entry into the scope of consolidation.

(1) During the 2024 financial year, the Group carried out an assessment at the acquisition date of the fair value of all tangible assets of the group: land, buildings and industrial equipment in the various countries of establishment. This assessment was carried out in particular with the assistance of consulting firms specializing in the real estate sector.

(2) Nexans also carried out an assessment of the intangible assets of the La Triveneta Cavi group over the same period. Two significant categories of intangible assets were identified and valued with the assistance of specialist consulting firms:
- Brands, which were considered to have a defined life of 20 years
- Customer relationships, considered to have a defined life of 14 years

(3) Valuation of inventories at their fair value at the date of acquisition.

(4) The Group has identified the fair value of liabilities and contingent liabilities at the acquisition date, taking into account the risks shared by the purchaser and the seller, in particular based on liability guarantee clauses.

(5) Deferred taxes recognized as part of the allocation of the purchase price: they cover deferred taxes recognized on the allocations of goodwill to tangible and intangible assets acquired as well as to liabilities and contingent liabilities identified at the acquisition date.

Please note that this provisional goodwill will become definitive at the end of a period of 12 months following the acquisition, i.e. May 31, 2025.

## Note 23. Equity

### A. Composition of the share capital

At December 31, 2024, Nexans S.A.'s capital stock comprised 43,753,380 fully paid-up shares, each with a par value of 1 euro and a single voting right (43,753,380 shares at December 31, 2023).

Nexans manages its equity with a long-term perspective aimed at ensuring the Group's liquidity, optimizing its financial structure and allowing its shareholders to benefit from strong cash flow generation.

The decision elements may be net profit per share targets, future cash flow forecasts or balance sheet balance in order to meet net debt criteria (leverage & gearing ratios).

### B. Distribution

At the Shareholders' Meeting, shareholders will be invited to vote on the distribution of a dividend of 2.60 euros per share, which taking into account the 43,753,380 ordinary shares comprising the Company's share capital at December 31, 2024, will represent a total distribution of 114 million euros.

If the Company holds any treasury shares at the time the dividend is paid, the amount corresponding to unpaid dividends on these shares will be allocated to retained earnings. The total amount of the dividend could be increased in order to reflect the number of additional shares that may be issued between January 1, 2025 and the date on which the Shareholders' Meeting is called to approve the dividend payment.

The fair value of free shares and performance shares is recorded as a payroll expense from the grant date to the end of the vesting period, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. In the income statement, this expense amounted to 19 million euros in 2024 (compared to an expense of 18 million euros in 2023) including the expense related to the employee share ownership plan.

## E. Put options granted to non-controlling interests

In September 2024, Nexans made a commitment to acquire the shares of the minority shareholders of Nexans Continuous Copper Casting and Refining, a company dedicated to the manufacture of copper wire from cathodes and recycled copper. This commitment is considered as a financial liability in accordance with IAS 32. This call / put option on 30% of the shares has an estimated maturity of 4y. It was recognized in financial liabilities in the amount of 30 million euros, against the Group's consolidated reserves.

At December 31, 2024, the financial debt represented 30 million euros.

The dividends paid on shares covered by this call / put option granted to non-controlling interests are analyzed as earn-outs and increase the amount of goodwill.

The audit procedures were carried out and the Statutory Auditors' report is is being issued at the date of the publication.

## C. Significant events of the year

Over the year actuarial gains are mainly due to the performance of invested funds for an amount of 14 million euros. Actuarial losses are linked to the decrease in discount rates, were offset by experience gains generated over the period. The latter are explained by the non-revaluation of annuities in Germany compared to the assumption of early revaluation. As for actuarial gains for the financial year 2023, they were mainly due to the decrease in discount rates partially offset by the performance of invested funds.

Two specific transactions were carried out in 2024, in Canada and the United States:
* In Canada, an annuity buyout transaction was carried out for one of the main plans eliminating the risk towards the beneficiaries of this plan. Thus the commitment relating to this plan was transferred almost entirely to an insurance company for a value of 30 million euros. This transfer was fully financed by the assets covering the plan, for a net impact that was not significant on income.
* In the United States, part of the commitment was settled by a lump sum payment offered to participants for 7 million euros, largely covered by the assets covering the plan. The impact on income is not significant.

The Group's employer contributions relating to defined benefit plans are estimated at 9 million euros for 2025.

Lastly, the other pension plans from which the Group's employees benefit correspond to defined-contribution plans, for which the Group has no commitment beyond the payment of contributions, which are recognized as expenses for the period. Contributions under these plans are recognized immediately as an expense. The amount of contributions paid in relation to these plans amounted to 126 million euros in 2024 (105 million euros in 2023).

## D. Analysis of actuarial gains and losses

Actuarial gains and losses arising on the Group's defined benefit obligation (DBO) can be analyzed as follows:

| | 2024 | | 2023 | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | in millions of euros | % of plan assets | in millions of euros | % of plan assets |
| Discount rate | 11 | 2% | 18 | 3% |

### F. Sensitivity analyses

The present value of the Group's obligation for pensions and other retirement benefits is sensitive to changes in discount rates. A 50 basis-point decrease in the discount rates applied would have had the following impacts on the present value of the Group's defined benefit obligation:

| At December 31 | 2024 |  |  |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|  | **Actual value in millions of euros** | **Adjusted value in millions of euros** | **% change** |
| Europe | 429 | 452 | 5.19% |
| North America | 111 | 116 | 4.70% |
| Asia | 14 | 14 | 3.36% |
| Other countries | 15 | 15 | 2.59% |
| **TOTAL** | **569** | **597** | **4.99%** |

The present value of the Group's obligation for pensions and other retirement benefits is also sensitive to changes in inflation rates. Depending on the type of plan concerned, changes in inflation rates can affect both the level of future salary increases and the amounts of annuity payments. A 50 basis-point increase in the inflation rates used would have had the following impacts on the present value of the Group's defined benefit obligation (assuming that the discount rates applied remain constant):

| At December 31 | 2024 |  |  |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|  | **Actual value in millions of euros** | **Adjusted value in millions of euros** | **% change** |
| Europe | 429 | 437 | 1.78% |
| North America | 111 | 111 | 0.00% |
| Asia | 14 | 14 | 0.00% |
| Other countries | 15 | 15 | 1.08% |
| **TOTAL** | **569** | **576** | **1.37%** |

### G. Characteristics of the main defined benefit plans and associated risks

The Group's main defined benefit plans are in Switzerland (39% of total benefit obligations at December 31, 2024) and Germany (27% of total benefit obligations at December 31, 2024).

**SWITZERLAND**

The pension plan of Nexans Suisse S.A. is a contribution-based plan with a guaranteed minimum rate of return and a fixed conversion rate on retirement. It offers benefits that comply with the Swiss Federal law on compulsory occupational benefits (the "LPP/BVG" law).

As specified in the LPP/BVG law, the plan has to be fully funded. Therefore, if there is a funding shortfall, measures must be taken to restore the plan to a fully funded position, such as by the employer and/or employees contributing additional financing and/or by reducing the benefits payable under the plan.

The pension fund is established as a separate legal entity. This foundation is responsible for the management of the plan and is composed of an equal number of employer and employee representatives. The strategic allocation of plan assets must comply with the investment guidelines put in place by the Foundation, which are aimed at limiting investment risks.

In addition, Nexans Suisse S.A. is exposed to a lifetime risk concerning the commitment. Indeed, almost three-quarters of commitments relate to retirees.

The life of the plan is approximately 10 years.

**GERMANY**

Nexans Deutschland GmbH's most significant plan is a defined benefit plan that has been closed to new entrants since January 2005. For former employees currently receiving benefits under the plan (and plan members who have not yet retired), pension benefits are calculated based on their vested rights as of the date the plan was closed. This plan is not funded.

Members are also covered against the risk of disability. In general, any disability payments due will be made on top of the amount of future pension benefits. In addition, the plan provides for reversionary benefits.

In addition, Nexans Deutschland GmbH is exposed to a lifetime risk and pension indexation risk concerning the commitment. In fact, nearly 90% of commitments relate to retirees.

The life of the plan is approximately 8 years.

| Accrued contract costs | 85 | 87 |
| Provisions for reorganization costs | 17 | 22 |
| Other provisions | 107 | 91 |

The movements in these provisions were as follows:

|:---------------------|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|
| AT DECEMBER 31, 2022 | 177 | 70 | 25 | 82 |

| Business combinations | - | - | - | - |
| Exchange differences and other | 6 | 3 | (0) | 3 |

| Exchange differences and other | (1) | (4) | 0 | 2 |
| AT DECEMBER 31, 2024 | 208 | 85 | 17 | 107 |

The above provisions have not been discounted as the effect of discounting would not have been generally material.

Provisions for accrued contract costs are primarily set aside by the Group as a result of its contractual responsibilities particularly relating to customer warranties, loss-making contracts, and penalties under commercial contracts (see Note 32). They include provisions for construction contracts in progress where applicable, in accordance with the method described in Note 1.E.a.

The reorganization costs amounted to 17 million euros in 2024. They mainly include social costs and external consultant expenses, including 10 million euros related to the transformation of Electrification activities (7 million euros in 2023) and 3 million euros related to the implementation of operational tools and processes preparing the segregation of the Electrification and non-Electrification activities (9 million euros in 2023).

As was the case in previous years, wherever possible, the reorganization plans implemented by the Group in 2024 included assistance measures negotiated with employee representative bodies as well as measures aimed at limiting lay-offs and facilitating redeployment.

The "Other provisions" column mainly includes provisions set aside for antitrust investigations, which amounted to 62 million euros at December 31, 2024 (62 million euros at December 31, 2023) (see Note 31).

Surplus provisions are reversed when the related contingency no longer exists or has been settled for a lower amount than the estimate made based on information available at the previous period-end (including provisions for expired customer warranties).

| **TOTAL SHORT-TERM DEBT**(b) | 4.31% | 4.09% | 193 | 569 |

(a) Effective interest rate
(b) Excluding lease liabilities

The vast majority of the Group's short-term debt is at fixed rates.

At December 31, 2023, short-term debt in euros consisted mainly of the ordinary bond to be repaid in 2024 and outstanding commercial papers mentioned in Note 29-A.

US dollar-denominated debt primarily concerns Colombia and Brazil.

Debt denominated in currencies other than euros and US dollars corresponds mainly to borrowings taken out locally by certain Group subsidiaries in Asia (China), Africa and the Middle East (Turkey, Morocco and Côte d'Ivoire) and South America (Brazil). In some cases, such local borrowing is required as the countries concerned do not have access to the Group's centralized financing facilities. However, it may also be set up in order to benefit from a particularly attractive interest rate or to avoid the risk of potentially significant foreign exchange risk depending on the geographic region in question.

### F. Analysis by maturity (including accrued interest)

Nexans Financial and Trading Services, a wholly-owned Nexans subsidiary, is responsible for the Group's centralized cash management. However, in its capacity as parent company, Nexans S.A. still carries out the Group's long-term bond issues.

Nexans Financial and Trading Services monitors changes in the liquidity facilities of the holding companies as well as the Group's overall financing structure on a weekly basis (see Note 29-A).

In view of Nexans' available short-term liquidity facilities and long-term debt structure, the Group's debt maturity schedule set out below is presented on a medium and long-term basis.

#### MATURITY SCHEDULE AT DECEMBER 31, 2024

| in millions of euros | Due within one year | Due in one to five years | Due beyond five years | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Notes concerning the preparation of the maturity schedule:
• foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives used to hedge the Group's external debt are not material for the Group as a whole.
• the euro equivalent amount for borrowings in foreign currencies has been calculated using the year-end exchange rate at December 31, 2024.

## 05 Consolidated financial statements

*The audit procedures were carried out and the Statutory Auditors' report is being issued at the date of the publication.*

## FOREIGN EXCHANGE DERIVATIVES

In 2024, the loss relating to the ineffective portion of the Group's foreign exchange derivatives amounted to 50 million euros. In the consolidated income statement this loss is included in "Other financial income and expenses" for the operations component of the hedge and in "Cost of debt (net)" for the financial component. A 73 million euro net loss on cash flow hedges was recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and a net loss of 41 million euros was recycled to the income statement.

## METAL DERIVATIVES

In 2024, the ineffective portion of gains or losses arising on the fair value remeasurement of metal derivatives designated as cash flow hedges represented a non-material amount that was recognized in the consolidated income statement on the line "Changes in fair value of non-ferrous metal derivatives" in "Other operating income and expenses".

An aggregate 17 million euro gain was recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for metal derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and a 13 million euro gain was recycled to the income statement.

## Note 26 - Financial risks

The Treasury, Financing and Metals Department defines the financial risk management policy covering:

* liquidity, foreign exchange, interest rate, credit and banking counterparty risks;
* risks relating to changes in non-ferrous metal prices, as well as the credit and financial counterparty risks of entities that trade in non-ferrous metals markets;
* the department is part of the legal entity Nexans Financial and Trading Services.

Where permitted by local regulations, Group subsidiaries' foreign exchange and interest rate risks are managed on a centralized basis and their access to liquidity is managed through a cash pooling system.

Nexans Financial and Trading Services is the counterparty for all hedges of commodities risks, except for those set up by subsidiaries in Brazil, South Korea, China, Australia and New Zealand.

The main subsidiaries that did not have access to the centralized cash management system at December 31, 2024, are located in Morocco, China, South Korea, Peru, Brazil, Chile, Ghana, Colombia and to some extent in Lebanon. These subsidiaries, which have their own banking partners, are nevertheless subject to Group procedures regarding their choice of banks and foreign exchange and interest rate risk management.

Non-ferrous metal risk management policy is also defined and controlled centrally for the entire Group by the Treasury, Financing and Metals Department, which takes centralized positions on the market based on requests from subsidiaries. At December 31, 2024, only subsidiaries in Australia, New Zealand and China had direct access to such markets.

### A. Liquidity risk

#### Monitoring and managing liquidity risk

The Treasury Financing and Metals Department monitors changes in the treasury and liquidity positions of the Group on a weekly basis (encompassing both holding companies and operating entities). As such, subsidiaries are required to provide cash forecasts for the four weeks of the current month as well as for the following two months. These forecasts are then compared to actual cash figures.

Bank borrowings taken out by subsidiaries that are not part of the Nexans Financial and Trading Services centralized cash management system must be approved in advance by the "Financing Committee" and may not have maturity dates exceeding 12 months, unless express authorization is obtained.

The key liquidity indicators that are monitored are the unused amounts of credit facilities granted to the Group and available cash and cash equivalents.

The Group also monitors its net debt position on a monthly basis (see Note 26 for the definition of net debt).

#### Management of cash surpluses

The Group's policy for investing cash surpluses is guided by the overriding principles of ensuring sufficient availability and using safe investment vehicles. The banks considered by the Group as acceptable counterparties must be rated at least A by Standard & Poor's and P2 by Moody's, or must be majority-owned by the government of their home country (which must be either an EU member, Canada or the United States).

At December 31, 2024, the Group's cash surpluses were recognized under "Cash and cash equivalents" in the consolidated balance sheet and were invested in:
* current accounts with banks considered by the Group as acceptable counterparties;
* money-market mutual funds (OPCVM) which are not exposed to changes in interest rates and whose underlying assets are investment-grade issues by both corporations and financial institutions; or
* term deposits and certificates of deposit issued by banks, with an initial investment period of less than one year.

As an exception to the above and due to the crisis in Lebanon, bank deposits in Lebanese banks have been excluded from cash and cash equivalents (see Note 26).

### Main sources of financing

Over the past several years the Group has implemented a strategy of diversifying its sources of financing through:
* issues of ordinary bonds maturing in 2027, 2029 and 2030 (see Note 26);
* a medium-term syndicated credit facility renewed on October 25, 2022 and now representing an amount of 800 million euros, lasting for an initial period of five years. In October 2023, the Group activated its second extension option bringing the maturity of the line to 2029;
* a loan facility granted by the European Investment Bank (EIB) for an amount of 200 million euros, fully drawn in April 2022.

(a) Including the short-term portion of accrued interest not yet due on long-term debt.

## 6. Foreign exchange and metal price risks

The Group's foreign exchange risk exposure primarily relates to operations-based transactions (purchases and sales).

Due to its international presence, the Group is exposed to foreign currency translation risk on the net assets of subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the euro. It is Group policy not to hedge these risks.

The Group's sensitivity to foreign exchange risk on operating cash flows is considered to be moderate due to its operational structure. Indeed, the majority of Nexans operating subsidiaries have a very strong local presence, except in the high-voltage business. The Group's policy is to hedge its foreign exchange and non-ferrous metal price risks on cash flows relating to foreseeable significant contractual commercial transactions and certain forecast transactions. The operations arising from this hedging activity may result in certain positions being kept open. Where this happens, the positions are limited in terms of amount and term, and they are overseen by the Treasury, Financing and Metal Department.

The risk management policy for non-ferrous metals is defined by the Finance Department. It is implemented by subsidiaries that purchase copper, aluminum and, to a lesser extent, lead. The Group's main exposure to metal price risk arises from fluctuations in copper prices.

### METHODS USED TO MONITOR AND HEDGE EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK

The Group verifies that its procedures for managing foreign exchange risk are properly applied by means of quarterly reports provided to the Treasury, Financing and Metals Department by all subsidiaries exposed to this type of risk, irrespective of whether or not they are members of the cash pool. The reports contain details on the subsidiaries' estimated future cash flows in each currency and the related hedges that have been set up, as well as a reconciliation between actual figures and previous forecasts.

The Treasury, Financing and Metals Department has developed training materials for the Group's operations teams and carries out ad hoc audits to ensure that the relevant procedures have been properly understood and applied. Lastly, the Internal Audit Department regularly verifies that the procedures for identifying and hedging foreign exchange risks have been properly applied during its audit engagements carried out at the Group's subsidiaries.

In addition, some bids are made in a currency other than that in which the entity concerned operates. Foreign exchange risks arising on these bids are not systematically hedged, which could generate a gain or loss for the Group if there is a significant fluctuation in the exchange rate between the date when the bid is presented and the date it is accepted by the customer. However, in such cases, the Group takes steps to reduce its potential risk by applying expiration dates to its bids and by incorporating the foreign exchange risk into the price proposal.

Foreign exchange risk is identified at the level of the Group's subsidiaries. The subsidiaries' treasurers execute hedges centrally or locally using forward currency transactions. For subsidiaries that are members of the cash pool, these transactions are carried out with the Treasury, Financing and Metals Department. Other subsidiaries enter into forward currency transactions with their local banks. The objective is to reduce flows in the subsidiary's functional currency and/or to avoid open positions in a given currency for a given maturity.

### METHODS USED TO MANAGE AND HEDGE EXPOSURE TO METAL RISK

The exposure of a certain number of subsidiaries to the risk of changes in non-ferrous metal prices is hedged at Group level. To this end, each Group company reports its exposures to the Treasury, Financing and Metals Department.

The Group verifies that its procedures for managing and hedging metal risks are correctly applied by means of each operating subsidiary reporting monthly on its exposure to copper, aluminum and lead risk in both tonnage and value terms. The related reports are analyzed and consolidated at Group level by the Treasury, Financing and Metals Department.

# NEXANS 2024 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## Consolidated financial statements 05

*The audit procedures were carried out and the Statutory Auditors' report is is being issued at the date of the publication.*

Cash deposited to meet margin calls on copper forward purchases whose fair value was negative at the year-end (see Note 27) amounted to 25 million euros at December 31, 2024 (19 million euros at December 31, 2023).

In conclusion, the Group has limited exposure to credit risk. The Group considers that its management of counterparty risk is in line with market practices but it cannot totally rule out a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements should it be faced with the occurrence of systemic risk.

### RISK ON DEPOSITS AND INVESTMENTS

Deposits and investments with banks of Nexans Financial Trading Services and Nexans Canada's surplus cash amounted to 824 million euros at December 31, 2024, representing approximately 92% of the Group's total cash and cash equivalents. All of these deposits and investments are with counterparties rated as investment grade by Standard & Poor's, with ratings of between A+ and AA-.

Nexans Financial Trading Services has no SICAV's shares as of December 31, 2024.

For the Group's other subsidiaries, counterparty risk on deposits and investments is managed in accordance with the principles and procedures described in Note 29-A.

### E. Market risk sensitivity analysis

A sensitivity analysis is provided below on the impact that a theoretical change in the above-mentioned main market risks would have on consolidated income and equity.

#### SENSITIVITY TO CHANGES IN COPPER PRICES

Fluctuations in copper prices can impact both consolidated income and equity, as well as the Group's financing needs. Sensitivity calculations are based on an assumed increase in copper prices. A fall in copper prices would have the inverse effect.

A rise in copper prices would result in:
* a rise in the fair value of the Group's portfolio of cash-settled copper derivatives (the Group is a net buyer).
* an upward remeasurement of the Group's Core exposure.

At Group level, the impact on working capital is limited and mainly relates to the timing of derivatives settlement. Potential significant variations could occur at local level due to pricing conditions.

An increase in the fair value of cash-settled copper derivatives would positively affect either consolidated operating income or equity, based on the accounting treatment used for these derivative instruments (the derivatives of the Group's main subsidiaries are designated as cash flow hedges within the meaning of IFRS 9).

The simulation below is based on the following assumptions (with all other assumptions remaining constant, notably exchange rates):

* a 10% increase in copper prices at December 31, 2023 and 2024, and translation of this impact evenly across the entire price curve without any distortion of forward point spreads.
* all working capital components (inventories and the copper component of trade receivables and payables) would be impacted by the increase in copper prices.
* 47,000 tons and 50,000 tons of copper included in working capital at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024, respectively.
* short-term interest rate (3-month Euribor) of 2.715% in 2024 and 4.291% in 2023. A worst-case scenario in which the increase in working capital would be constant throughout the year, leading to an annualized increase in financial expenses (not taking into account the temporary positive impact of margin calls or the effect of changes in exchange rates).
* 43,350 tons of copper classified as core exposure at December 31, 2024 and 42,900 tons at December 31, 2023.
* using a theoretical income tax rate of 25.83% in 2024 as in 2023.

Any impact of changes in copper prices on both impairment in value of the Group's non-current assets (in accordance with IAS 36) and the provision for impairment of inventories has not been taken into account in this simulation, as it is impossible to identify a direct linear effect.

| At December 31, in millions of euros | 2024 | 2023 |
| ------------------------------------ | ---- | ---- |
| Impact on operating income | 36 | 33 |
| Impact on financial income and expenses | (1) | (1) |
| NET IMPACT ON INCOME (AFTER TAX) | 26 | 23 |
| IMPACT ON EQUITY* (AFTER TAX) | 24 | 20 |

## COMMITMENTS GIVEN TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE

All of the commitments given to Christopher Guérin in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) are described in detail each year in the Universal Registration Document (section entitled "Commitments given to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO)").

As Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Christopher Guérin has received the following commitments from the Company, which were decided at the Board meeting and approved yearly at the Shareholders' Meeting:

1) If Christopher Guérin is removed from his position as Chief Executive Officer (CEO), he will be entitled to payment of a termination indemnity representing two years' worth of his total fixed and variable compensation. This indemnity will be subject to actual performance in relation to the objectives applicable to his target annual variable compensation being at least equal to 80% of said objectives on average over the three years preceding his removal. This indemnity will be payable only in the event of a forced departure due to a change of control or strategy, which will be deemed to be the case unless specifically decided otherwise by the Board of Directors, notably in the event of serious misconduct.

2) As compensation for an undertaking not to exercise any business that would compete either directly or indirectly with any of the Company's businesses for a period of two years from the end of his term of office as Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Christopher Guérin will receive a non-compete indemnity, regardless of the cause of termination of his duties. Said indemnity will be paid in 24 equal and successive monthly installments and will equal one year of his fixed and variable compensation, i.e., 12 times the amount of his most recent monthly compensation (fixed portion) plus the corresponding percentage of his bonus. The Board could decide to impose a non-competition obligation on the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) for a period shorter than two years. In such a case, the non-competition indemnity would be reduced pro rata temporis.

In accordance with Article 25.3 of the Afep-Medef Code (December 2022 version), in the event of Christopher Guérin's departure the Board of Directors will decide whether or not the non-compete agreement entered into with him will apply and will be entitled to cancel it (in which case no non-compete indemnity will be payable).

In addition, in accordance with Article 25.4 of the Afep-Medef Code, no non-compete indemnity will be due if Christopher Guérin takes retirement upon leaving the Group. In any event, no indemnity shall be paid beyond the age of 65.

Lastly, in accordance with the compensation policy for corporate officers described in Section 4 of this Document, all severance benefits (termination benefits and non-compete benefits) may not exceed two years' worth of actual compensation (fixed and variable).

If Christopher Guérin retired, he would be entitled to benefits under the supplementary defined contribution pension plan set up by the Group in 2019 for certain employees and corporate officers. The annual contribution paid by the Company corresponds to 20% of the Chief Executive Officer's total actual annual compensation (fixed plus variable), i.e., 330,000 euros in 2024.

## Note 30: Disputes and contingent liabilities

### A. Antitrust investigations

In January 2009, antitrust investigations were launched in several countries against various cable manufacturers including Group companies in relation to alleged anticompetitive behavior in the submarine and underground high-voltage power cables sector.

On April 7, 2014, Nexans France SAS and the Company were notified of the European Commission's decision (EC Decision), which found that Nexans France SAS had participated directly in an infringement of European antitrust legislation in the submarine and underground high-voltage power cable sector. The Company was held jointly liable for the payment of a portion of the fine imposed on Nexans France SAS by the European Commission.

In early July 2014, Nexans France SAS paid 70.6 million euro fine imposed on it by the European Commission.

## Consolidated financial statements

*The audit procedures were carried out and the Statutory Auditors' report is being issued at the date of the publication.*

### C. Significant events of the year

Over the year actuarial gains are mainly due to the performance of invested funds for an amount of 15 million euros. Actuarial losses are linked to the decrease in discount rates, were offset by experience gains generated over the period. The latter are explained by the non-revaluation of annuities in Germany compared to the assumption of early revaluation. As for actuarial gains for the financial year 2023, they were mainly due to the decrease in discount rates partially offset by the performance of invested funds.

Two specific transactions were carried out in 2024, in Canada and the United States:
- In Canada, an annuity buyout transaction was carried out for one of the main plans eliminating the risk towards the beneficiaries of this plan. Thus the commitment relating to this plan was transferred almost entirely to an insurance company for a value of 20 million euros. This transfer was fully financed by the assets covering the plan, for a net impact that was not significant on income.
- In the United States, part of the commitment was settled by a lump sum payment offered to participants for 7 million euros, largely covered by the assets covering the plan. The impact on income is not significant.

The Group's employer contributions relating to defined benefit plans are estimated at 8 million euros for 2025.

Lastly, the other pension plans from which the Group's employees benefit correspond to defined-contribution plans, for which the Group has no commitment beyond the payment of contributions, which are recognized as expenses for the period. Contributions under these plans are recognized immediately as an expense. The amount of contributions paid in relation to these plans amounted to 125 million euros in 2024 (105 million euros in 2023).

### D. Analysis of actuarial gains and losses

Actuarial gains and losses arising on the Group's defined benefit obligation (DBO) can be analyzed as follows:

| | 2024 | | 2023 | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | in millions of euros | % of plan assets | in millions of euros | % of plan assets |
| Discount rate | 11 | 2% | 18 | 3% |

### F. Sensitivity analyses

The present value of the Group's obligation for pensions and other retirement benefits is sensitive to changes in discount rates. A 50 basis-point decrease in the discount rates applied would have had the following impacts on the present value of the Group's defined benefit obligation:

| At December 31 | 2024 |  |  |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
|  | **Actual value in millions of euros** | **Adjusted value in millions of euros** | **% change** |
| Europe | 429 | 452 | 5.19% |
| North America | 111 | 116 | 4.70% |
| Asia | 14 | 14 | 3.36% |
| Other countries | 15 | 15 | 2.59% |
| **TOTAL** | **569** | **597** | **4.99%** |

The present value of the Group's obligation for pensions and other retirement benefits is also sensitive to changes in inflation rates. Depending on the type of plan concerned, changes in inflation rates can affect both the level of future salary increases and the amounts of annuity payments. A 50 basis-point increase in the inflation rates used would have had the following impacts on the present value of the Group's defined benefit obligation (assuming that the discount rates applied remain constant):

| At December 31 | 2024 |  |  |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
|  | **Actual value in millions of euros** | **Adjusted value in millions of euros** | **% change** |
| Europe | 429 | 437 | 1.78% |
| North America | 111 | 111 | 0.00% |
| Asia | 14 | 14 | 0.00% |
| Other countries | 15 | 15 | 1.08% |
| **TOTAL** | **569** | **576** | **1.37%** |

### G. Characteristics of the main defined benefit plans and associated risks

The Group's main defined benefit plans are in Switzerland (39% of total benefit obligations at December 31, 2024) and Germany (27% of total benefit obligations at December 31, 2024).

#### SWITZERLAND
The pension plan of Nexans Suisse S.A. is a contribution-based plan with a guaranteed minimum rate of return and a fixed conversion rate on retirement. It offers benefits that comply with the Swiss Federal law on compulsory occupational benefits (the "LPP/BVG" law).

As specified in the LPP/BVG law, the plan has to be fully funded. Therefore, if there is a funding shortfall, measures must be taken to restore the plan to a fully funded position, such as by the employer and/or employees contributing additional financing and/or by reducing the benefits payable under the plan.

The pension fund is established as a separate legal entity. This foundation is responsible for the management of the plan and is composed of an equal number of employer and employee representatives. The strategic allocation of plan assets must comply with the investment guidelines put in place by the Foundation, which are aimed at limiting investment risks.

In addition, Nexans Suisse S.A. is exposed to a lifetime risk concerning the commitment. Indeed, almost three-quarters of commitments relate to retirees.

The life of the plan is approximately 10 years.

#### GERMANY
Nexans Deutschland GmbH's most significant plan is a defined benefit plan that has been closed to new entrants since January 2005. For former employees currently receiving benefits under the plan (and plan members who have not yet retired), pension benefits are calculated based on their vested rights as of the date the plan was closed. This plan is not funded.

Members are also covered against the risk of disability. In general, any disability payments due will be made on top of the amount of future pension benefits. In addition, the plan provides for reversionary benefits.

In addition, Nexans Deutschland GmbH is exposed to a lifetime risk and pension indexation risk concerning the commitment. In fact, nearly 80% of commitments relate to retirees.

The life of the plan is approximately 8 years.

The above provisions have not been discounted as the effect of discounting would not have been generally material.

Provisions for accrued contract costs are primarily set aside by the Group as a result of its contractual responsibilities, particularly relating to customer warranties, loss-making contracts, and penalties under commercial contracts (see Note 32). They include provisions for construction contracts in progress where applicable, in accordance with the method described in Note 1.E.a.

The reorganization costs amounted to 17 million euros in 2024. They mainly include social costs and external consultant expenses, including 10 million euros related to the transformation of Electrification activities (15 million euros in 2023) and 5 million euros related to the implementation of operational tools and processes preparing the segregation of the Electrification and non-Electrification activities (7 million euros in 2023).

As was the case in previous years, wherever possible, the reorganization plans implemented by the Group in 2024 included assistance measures negotiated with employee representative bodies as well as measures aimed at limiting lay-offs and facilitating redeployment.

The "Other provisions" column mainly includes provisions set aside for antitrust investigations, which amounted to 85 million euros at December 31, 2024 (65 million euros at December 31, 2023) (see Note 33).

Surplus provisions are reversed when the related contingency no longer exists or has been settled for a lower amount than the estimate made based on information available at the previous period-end (including provisions for expired customer warranties).

### C. Ordinary bonds

| in millions of euros | Carrying amount at end-2024 | Face value at issue date | Maturity date | Nominal interest rate |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| Ordinary bonds redeemable in 2028 | 415 | 400 | April 5, 2028 | 5.50% |

| **TOTAL ORDINARY BONDS**(a) | 1,359 | 1,325 | | |

*(a) Including 22 million euros in short-term accrued interest*

On March 11, 2024, Nexans carried out a first bond issue for an amount of 350 million euros, with a six-year maturity and an annual interest of 4.25%. The bonds were issued at par.

On April 5, 2023, Nexans redeemed the 325-million-euro bond issue subscribed in 2017 for a firm period of seven years.

On May 29, 2023, a second bond issue was carried out for an amount of 575 million euros, with a five-year maturity and an annual interest of 4.125%. The bonds were issued at 100.47% of par.

On April 5, 2022, Nexans completed its first sustainability bond issue for an amount of 400 million euros. This five-year fixed-rate issue (maturing on April 5, 2028) carried an annual coupon of 5.5%. The bonds were issued at par. This first sustainable development bond was part of Nexans' "Sustainable Financing Framework". The bonds issued are linked to the climate objectives that Nexans has set for December 31, 2026, for the reduction of its Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions, as well as for the Cradle-to-Shelf portion of Scope 3 emissions products. Failure to comply with any of these obligations would result in an increase of 50 basis points in the coupon rate of the last year.

Refer more generally to Note 2 for the Group's consideration of climate change.

### D. Other borrowings

On October 6, 2021, the European Investment Bank (EIB) granted Nexans a loan facility in the amount of 200 million euros intended to promote its active participation in the global energy transition and its commitment within the framework of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to achieve "Net-Zero" emissions by 2050.

On April 5, 2022, Nexans drew down the entire financing line, i.e. an amount of 200 million euros. The loan, repayable at maturity, has a maturity of five years (maturing on April 5, 2027) and carries a fixed-rate annual coupon of 1.93%. The accrued interest not yet due amounted to 3 million euros at December 31, 2024.

Short-term borrowings also include 140 million euros in outstanding commercial papers with an average maturity of three months.

### E. Analysis of gross debt by currency and interest rate

#### LONG-TERM FINANCIAL BORROWINGS AND DEBT

The majority of Nexans' medium and long-term debt is at fixed rates.

The long-term debt includes mainly a debt for a Put call option (see Note 23.D) and a debt in France linked to a sale-leaseback project that did not meet the criteria to be qualified as a sale within the meaning of IFRS 16. They also include financial debts denominated in currencies other than the euro linked to loans granted in China and in Côte d'Ivoire.

| (a) Effective interest rate
| (b) Excluding lease liabilities

The vast majority of the Group's short-term debt is at fixed rates.

At December 31, 2023, short-term debt in euros consisted mainly of the ordinary bond to be repaid in 2024 and outstanding commercial papers mentioned in Note 29-A.

US dollar-denominated debt primarily concerns Colombia and Brazil.

Debt denominated in currencies other than euros and US dollars corresponds mainly to borrowings taken out locally by certain Group subsidiaries in Asia (China), Africa and the Middle East (Turkey, Morocco and Côte d'Ivoire) and South America (Brazil). In some cases, such local borrowing is required as the countries concerned do not have access to the Group's centralized financing facilities. However, it may also be set up in order to benefit from a particularly attractive interest rate or to avoid the risk of potentially significant foreign exchange risk depending on the geographic region in question.

### F. Analysis by maturity (including accrued interest)

Nexans Financial and Trading Services, a wholly-owned Nexans subsidiary, is responsible for the Group's centralized cash management. However, in its capacity as parent company, Nexans S.A. still carries out the Group's long-term bond issues. Nexans Financial and Trading Services monitors changes in the liquidity facilities of the holding companies as well as the Group's overall financing structure on a weekly basis (see Note 29-A).

In view of Nexans' available short-term liquidity facilities and long-term debt structure, the Group's debt maturity schedule set out below is presented on a medium and long-term basis.

#### MATURITY SCHEDULE AT DECEMBER 31, 2024

Notes concerning the preparation of the maturity schedule:
• foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives used to hedge the Group's external debt are not material for the Group as a whole.
• the euro equivalent amount for borrowings in foreign currencies has been calculated using the year-end exchange rate at December 31, 2024.

In the context of its copper purchases, market practices allow the Group to take part in financing transactions allowing payment on delivery by the supplier by a banking institution and then payment by the Group on the due date of the banking institutions initial invoice. The cost of financing the transaction is negotiated upstream with the supplier which includes it in its invoices to the Group. These transactions do not result in any extension for the Group of the payment period initially granted by the supplier (which remains unchanged) and do not have the effect of allowing suppliers to be paid before the due date of their invoice (this possibility existed previously and independently). The Group therefore considered that they did not fall within the scope of reverse factoring or any other financing transactions for trade payables within the meaning of the amendment to IFRS 7 published in May 2023.

Trade payables relating to copper purchases have maturities ranging from 30 to 120 days depending on the geographical area in which the purchase transaction takes place and the various contractual agreements. At December 31, 2024, the Group's trade payables included an amount of 341 million euros (270 million euros at December 31, 2023) relating to these negotiated payment terms.

The various tools implemented by the Group, detailed in Note 29 to the consolidated financial statements, would mitigate the liquidity risk that could be induced by the termination of the aforementioned transactions.

The amounts due to suppliers of fixed assets totaled 7 million euros at December 31, 2024 (14 million euros at December 31, 2023).

### FINANCING AND ACCELERATION CLAUSES

On October 26, 2022, the Group signed a new syndicated credit agreement for an amount of 800 million euros replacing the syndicated credit agreement signed in 2018. Its maturity date was extended to October 26, 2029, following the exercise of the second extension option by the Group.

On October 6, 2022, the European Investment Bank (EIB) granted Nexans a loan facility in the amount of 200 million euros, intended to promote its active participation in the global energy transition and its commitment within the framework of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), to achieve "Net-Zero" emissions by 2050.

In April 2023, the Group drew down this financing for an amount of 200 million euros. The repayment will be made in fine in April 2027.

The renewed syndicated loan and the loan granted by the European Investment Bank (EIB) are subject to the following two financial covenants:

* the consolidated net debt to equity ratio (including non-controlling interests) must not exceed 1.20, and
* a consolidated debt is capped at 3.2x consolidated EBITDA as defined in Note E.b.

These ratios were well within the specified limits at both December 31, 2023, and at the date the Board of Directors approved the financial statements.

If any of the covenants were breached, the syndicated credit facility or the European Investment Bank (EIB) loan facility would become unavailable and any drawdowns would be repayable, either immediately or after a contractual cure period depending on the nature of the breach.

The Group is not subject to any other financial ratio covenants.

The syndicated loan agreement and the European Investment Bank (EIB) loan contain standard covenants (negative pledge, cross default, pari passu and change of control clauses), which if breached could accelerate repayment of the syndicated loan or the bond debt.

### B. Interest rate risk

The Group structures its financing in such a way as to avoid exposure to the risk of rises in interest rates:

* The Group's medium and long-term debt is predominantly at fixed rates and at December 31, 2023, mainly consisted of the 2023 and 2028 bond issues and the loan from the European Investment Bank (EIB).

* The Group's short-term debt includes commercial paper at fixed rates of interest that is due within 3 months. The remainder of the Group's short-term debt is at a variable rate based on monetary indicators depending on the underlying currency (ESTER, EURIBOR, SOFR, SONIA, etc.).

* Fixed-rate debts with original maturities of less than one year are considered as variable-rate debts. Short-term cash surpluses are invested in instruments which have maturities of less than one year (fixed rate renegotiated at renewal) or variable-rate instruments (ESTER, EURIBOR, SOFR, SONIA, etc.). Consequently, the Group's net exposure to short-term changes in interest rates is limited active net exposure of 420 million euros at December 31, 2023, and 219 million euros at December 31, 2022.

The Group did not have any interest rate hedges in place in either 2023 or 2022.

## Foreign exchange and metal price risks

The Group's foreign exchange risk exposure primarily relates to operations-based transactions (purchases and sales).

Due to its international presence, the Group is exposed to foreign currency translation risk on the net assets of subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the euro. It is Group policy not to hedge these risks.

The Group's sensitivity to foreign exchange risk on operating cash flows is considered to be moderate due to its operational structure. Indeed, the majority of Nexans operating subsidiaries have a very strong local presence, except in the high-voltage business. The Group's policy is to hedge its foreign exchange and non-ferrous metal price risks on cash flows relating to foreseeable significant contractual commercial transactions and certain forecast transactions. The operations arising from this hedging activity may result in certain positions being kept open. Where this happens, the positions are limited in terms of amount and term, and they are overseen by the Treasury, Financing and Metals Department.

The risk management policy for non-ferrous metals is defined by the Finance Department. It is implemented by subsidiaries that purchase copper, aluminum, and to a lesser extent, lead. The Group's main exposure to metal price risk arises from fluctuations in copper prices.

### METHODS USED TO MANAGE AND HEDGE EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK

The Group verifies that its procedures for managing foreign exchange risk are properly applied by means of quarterly reports provided to the Treasury, Financing and Metals Department by all subsidiaries exposed to this type of risk, irrespective of whether or not they are members of the cash pool. The reports contain details on the subsidiaries' estimated future cash flows in each currency and the related hedges that have been set up, as well as a reconciliation between actual figures and previous forecasts.

The Treasury, Financing and Metals Department has developed training materials for the Group's operations teams and carries out ad hoc audits to ensure that the relevant procedures have been properly understood and applied. Lastly, the Internal Audit Department regularly verifies that the procedures for identifying and hedging foreign exchange risks have been properly applied during its audit engagements carried out at the Group's subsidiaries.

In addition, some bids are made in a currency other than that in which the entity concerned operates. Foreign exchange risks arising on these bids are not systematically hedged, which could generate a gain or loss for the Group if there is a significant fluctuation in the exchange rate between the date when the bid is presented and the date it is accepted by the customer. However, in such cases, the Group takes steps to reduce its potential risk by applying expiration dates to its bids and by incorporating the foreign exchange risk into the price proposal.

Foreign exchange risk is identified at the level of the Group's subsidiaries. The subsidiaries' treasurers execute hedges centrally or locally using forward currency transactions. For subsidiaries that are members of the cash pool, these transactions are carried out with the Treasury, Financing and Metals Department. Other subsidiaries enter into forward currency transactions with their local banks. The objective is to reduce flows in the subsidiary's functional currency and/or to avoid open positions in a given currency for a given maturity.

### METHODS USED TO MANAGE AND HEDGE EXPOSURE TO METAL RISK

The exposure of a certain number of subsidiaries to the risk of changes in non-ferrous metal prices is hedged at Group level. To this end, each Group company reports its exposures to the Treasury, Financing and Metals Department.

The Group verifies that its procedures for managing and hedging metal risks are correctly applied by means of each operating subsidiary reporting monthly on its exposure to copper, aluminum and lead risk in both tonnage and value terms. The related reports are analyzed and consolidated at Group level by the Treasury, Financing and Metals Department.

# NEXANS 2024 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## 05 Consolidated financial statements

*The audit procedures were carried out and the Statutory Auditors' report is being issued at the date of the publication.*

In addition, the Treasury, Financing and Metals Department regularly provides training sessions and performs controls within the subsidiaries to ensure that the procedures are properly understood and applied. It has also created training modules on the Group intranet for operations teams, including salespeople, buyers, finance staff and "hedging operators" who are in charge of daily hedging activities concerning metal risks. Lastly, the Internal Audit Department systematically checks that the procedures for identifying and hedging metal risks have been properly applied during its audit engagements carried out at the Group's operating subsidiaries.

In order to offset the consequences of the volatility of non-ferrous metal prices (copper and to a lesser extent aluminum and lead), Nexans' policy is to pass on metal prices in its own selling prices and hedge the related risk either by setting up a physical hedge or by entering into futures contracts on the London, New York and to a lesser degree, Shanghai metal exchanges. Nexans does not generate any income from the speculative trading of metals.

The Group's production units require access at all times to a minimum level of metal inventories for their routine operations, which is referred to as "Core exposure". Core exposure represents the minimum amounts that are necessary for the production units to operate appropriately. Consequently, the quantities of metal corresponding to core exposure are not hedged and are recorded within operating margin based on initial purchase cost. However, as described in Note 1.E.c, at the level of operating income, core exposure is measured at its weighted average cost and therefore the difference between historical cost and weighted average cost is recognized under "Core exposure effect" in the income statement.

As a result, any reduction (via sales) in the volume of core exposure due to structural changes in the needed tonnages for the operations of an entity, in the event of structural reorganizations within the Group or a lasting significant change in the business levels of certain operations, can impact the Group's operating margin.

In addition, the Group's operating margin is still partially exposed to fluctuations in non-ferrous metal prices for certain product lines, such as copper cables for cabling systems and building sector products. In these markets, any changes in non-ferrous metal prices are generally passed on in the selling price, but with a time lag that can impact margins. The fierce competition in these markets also affects the timescale within which price increases are passed on.

In accordance with its risk management policy described above, the Group enters into physical contracts only for operational purposes (for the copper component of customer or supplier orders) and uses futures contracts only for hedging purposes (LME, COMEX or SHFE traded contracts, see Note 27.D "Metals derivatives"). The Group's main subsidiaries document their hedging relationships in compliance with the requirements of IFRS relating to cash flow hedges.

### D. Credit and counterparty risk

In addition to customer credit risk, counterparty risk arises primarily on foreign exchange and non-ferrous metal derivatives as well as on the Group's investments and deposits placed with banks.

#### CUSTOMER CREDIT RISK

The Group's diverse business and customer base and wide geographic reach are natural mitigating factors for customer credit risk. At December 31, 2024, no single customer in any country represented more than 5% of the Group's total outstanding receivables except for Svenska Kraftnät (10%).

The Group also applies a proactive policy for managing and reducing its customer credit risk by means of a Group-wide credit management policy which has been rolled out to Nexans' international subsidiaries. A portion of trade receivables is not covered by this Group insurance program and case-by-case studies are carried out to find solutions. The recent economic and political crises around the world have made the market environment difficult. The Group focuses on optimizing credit and collection procedures, to limit the incidence of late payments and disputes. As a result and in view of the current relatively favorable situation of the policy, the credit insurer has confirmed its support and its willingness to support Nexans' future growth strategy.

#### FOREIGN EXCHANGE DERIVATIVES

In accordance with Group policy to keep counterparty risk as low as possible, entities wishing to hedge the foreign exchange risk on their medium or long-term commercial commitments may only purchase long-term derivatives (expiring in more than one year) from banks that have been assigned medium and long-term ratings of at least A- by Standard & Poor's and A3 by Moody's. For short-term derivatives (expiring in less than one year), the banks must have been assigned short-term ratings of at least A-1 by Standard & Poor's and P-1 by Moody's. Where this requirement cannot be fulfilled due to local banking conditions, the entities in the countries concerned limit their counterparty risk by keeping their exposure to a minimum and spreading it between at least three banks.

For subsidiaries that are not members of the cash pool, the same criteria apply but exceptions may be made, notably for subsidiaries located in countries with sovereign ratings that are below the specified thresholds. In this case, subsidiaries are asked to set up derivatives involving counterparty risk only with branches or subsidiaries of banking groups whose parent company satisfies the above risk criteria.

Based on a breakdown by maturity of the notional amounts at December 31, 2024 (the sum of the absolute values of the notional amounts of buyer and seller positions), the Group's main exposure for all subsidiaries (both members and non-members of the cash pool) is to short-term maturities.

## METAL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

The Nexans Group hedges its exposure to copper, aluminum and to a lesser extent lead by entering into derivatives transactions in three organized markets: the LME in London, the COMEX in New York and in certain limited cases, the SHFE in Shanghai. Substantially all of the derivatives transactions conducted by the Group are standard buy and sell trades. The Group does not generally use metal options.

The Treasury Financing and Metals Department performs metal derivatives transactions on behalf of substantially all of the Group's subsidiaries apart from, at December 31, 2024, its Australian, New Zealand and Chinese entities. Non-ferrous metal hedging transactions carried out on commodity exchanges may give rise to two different types of counterparty risk:

- the risk of not recovering cash deposits made (margin calls); and
- the replacement risk for contracts on which the counterparty defaults (mark-to-market exposure, i.e., the risk that the terms of a replacement contract will be different from those in the initial contract).

The Treasury Financing and Metals Department manages counterparty risk on the Group's derivative instruments by applying a procedure that sets ceilings by counterparty and by type of transaction. The level of these ceilings depends notably on the counterparties' ratings. In addition, the transactions carried out are governed by master netting agreements developed by major international Futures and Options Associations that allow for the netting of credit and debit balances on each contract.

The Group's counterparties for these transactions are usually its existing financial partners, provided they have a long-term rating of at least A-/A3. Counterparties rated between BBB-/Baa3 and BBB+/Baa1 can also be approved provided the Group's aggregate exposure to these counterparties does not exceed 20 million US dollars for counterparties rated BBB+/Baa1 or BBB in Australia and New Zealand. Because of the countries' time zone, the Group's subsidiaries carry out metal derivatives transactions with an Australian broker which is not rated. However, the Group only has a low level of exposure to this broker. Subsidiaries in China hedge their metal risks on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE), which can only be used by local brokers.

The Group's metal derivatives transactions are governed for the most part by master netting agreements developed by major international futures and options associations that in the event of a default allow for the netting of a Group subsidiary's assets and liabilities related to the defaulting counterparty.

The Group's maximum theoretical counterparty risk on its metal derivatives transactions can be measured as the sum of credit balances (including positive mark-to-market adjustments) and cash deposits after contractually permitted asset and liability netting. At December 31, 2024, this maximum theoretical risk was limited to 4 million euros. It amounted to 9 million euros at December 31, 2023.

The notional amounts of metal derivatives (sum of the absolute values of buy and sell positions) at December 31, 2024 are analyzed by maturity in the table below:

| At December 31, in millions of euros | 2024 |  | 2023 |  |

# NEXANS 2024 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## Consolidated financial statements 05

The audit procedures were carried out and the Statutory Auditors' report is is being issued at the date of the publication.

Cash deposited to meet margin calls on copper forward purchases whose fair value was negative at the year-end (see Note 27) amounted to 5 million euros at December 31, 2024 (8 million euros at December 31, 2023).

In conclusion, the Group has limited exposure to credit risk. The Group considers that its management of counterparty risk is in line with market practices but it cannot totally rule out a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements should it be faced with the occurrence of systemic risk.

### RISK ON DEPOSITS AND INVESTMENTS

Deposits and investments with banks of Nexans Financial Trading Services and Nexans Canada's surplus cash amounted to 824 million euros at December 31, 2024, representing approximately 29% of the Group's total cash and cash equivalents. All of these deposits and investments are with counterparties rated as investment grade by Standard & Poor's, with ratings of between A and AA.

Nexans Financial Trading Services has no SICAV's shares as of December 31, 2024.

For the Group's other subsidiaries, counterparty risk on deposits and investments is managed in accordance with the principles and procedures described in Note 29.A.

### E. Market risk sensitivity analysis

A sensitivity analysis is provided below on the impact that a theoretical change in the above-mentioned main market risks would have on consolidated income and equity.

#### SENSITIVITY TO CHANGES IN COPPER PRICES

Fluctuations in copper prices can impact both consolidated income and equity, as well as the Group's financing needs. Sensitivity calculations are based on an assumed increase in copper prices. A fall in copper prices would have the inverse effect.

A rise in copper prices would result in:
* a rise in the fair value of the Group's portfolio of cash-settled copper derivatives (the Group is a net buyer);
* an upward remeasurement of the Group's Core exposure.

At Group level, the impact on working capital is limited and mainly relates to the timing of derivatives settlement. Potential significant variations could occur at local level due to pricing conditions.

An increase in the fair value of cash-settled copper derivatives would positively affect either consolidated operating income or equity, based on the accounting treatment used for these derivative instruments (the derivatives of the Group's main subsidiaries are designated as cash flow hedges within the meaning of IFRS 9).

The simulation below is based on the following assumptions (with all other assumptions remaining constant, notably exchange rates):
* a 10% increase in copper prices at December 31, 2023 and 2024, and translation of this impact evenly across the entire price curve without any distortion of forward points/spreads
* all working capital components (inventories and the copper component of trade receivables and payables) would be impacted by the increase in copper prices
* 47,000 tons and 50,000 tons of copper included in working capital at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024, respectively
* short-term interest rate (3-month Euribor) of 2.715% in 2024 and 3.93% in 2023. A worst-case scenario in which the increase in working capital would be constant throughout the year, leading to an annualized increase in financial expenses (not taking into account the temporary positive impact of margin calls or the effect of changes in exchange rates)
* 43,350 tons of copper classified as core exposure at December 31, 2024 and 43,750 tons at December 31, 2023
* using a theoretical income tax rate of 25.83% in 2024 as in 2023

Any impact of changes in copper prices on both impairment in value of the Group's non-current assets (in accordance with IAS 36) and the provision for impairment of inventories has not been taken into account in this simulation, as it is impossible to identify a direct linear effect.

| At December 31, in millions of euros | 2024 | 2023 |

## Consolidated financial statements

*The audit procedures were carried out and the Statutory Auditors' report is being issued at the date of the publication.*

## SENSITIVITY TO THE US DOLLAR (USD) AND NORWEGIAN KRONE (NOK) EXCHANGE RATES

The main impacts on the consolidated financial statements stem from the revaluation of the Group's portfolio of derivative instruments. The impact on equity related to designated cash flow hedges and the impact on income have been separated out. The impact on income is offset by the revaluation of underlying US dollar positions included in the Group's trade receivables and trade payables portfolios, and net debt.

The Group's other financial assets and liabilities are only exceptionally subject to foreign exchange risk. They were not taken into account in this simulation.

The US dollar is the main foreign currency to which the Group is exposed.

The simulation is based on a 10% decrease in the US dollar spot rate against the world's other major currencies compared with the rates prevailing at December 31, 2023 and 2022 (e.g., using USD/EUR exchange rates of 1.10 and 1.07 respectively, without any changes in the forward points curve).

The Norwegian krone (NOK) is an essential counterparty currency used in contracts for subsea high-voltage cables.

The simulation is based on similar assumptions to those used for the US dollar (i.e., a 10% decrease in the Norwegian krone spot rate against the world's other major currencies), e.g., using closing NOK/EUR exchange rates of 11.50 and 10.74 at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, without any changes in the forward points curve.

Foreign currency translation impacts have not been taken into account in the following calculations:

## COMMITMENTS GIVEN TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE

All of the commitments given to Christopher Guérin in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) are described in detail each year in the Universal Registration Document (section entitled "Commitments given to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO)").

As Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Christopher Guérin has received the following commitments from the Company, which were decided at the Board meeting and approved yearly at the Shareholders' Meeting:

* If Christopher Guérin is removed from his position as Chief Executive Officer (CEO), he will be entitled to payment of a termination indemnity representing two years' worth of his total fixed and variable compensation. This indemnity will be subject to actual performance in relation to the objectives applicable to his target annual variable compensation being at least equal to 80% of said objectives on average over the three years preceding his removal. This indemnity will be payable only in the event of a forced departure due to a change of control or strategy, which will be deemed to be the case unless specifically decided otherwise by the Board of Directors, notably in the event of serious misconduct.

* As compensation for an undertaking not to exercise any business that would compete either directly or indirectly with any of the Company's businesses for a period of two years from the end of his term of office as Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Christopher Guérin will receive a non-compete indemnity, regardless of the cause of termination of his duties. Said indemnity will be paid in 24 equal and successive monthly installments and will equal one year of his fixed and variable compensation, i.e., 12 times the amount of his most recent monthly compensation (fixed portion) plus the corresponding percentage of his bonus. The Board could decide to impose a non-competition obligation on the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) for a period shorter than two years. In such a case, the non-competition indemnity would be reduced pro rata temporis.

In accordance with Article 25.3 of the Afep-Medef Code (December 2022 version), in the event of Christopher Guérin's departure the Board of Directors will decide whether or not the non-compete agreement entered into with him will apply and will be entitled to cancel it (in which case no non-compete indemnity will be payable).

In addition, in accordance with Article 24.4 of the Afep-Medef Code, no non-compete indemnity will be due if Christopher Guérin takes retirement upon leaving the Group. In any event, no indemnity shall be paid beyond the age of 65.

Lastly, in accordance with the compensation policy for corporate officers described in Section 4 of this Document, all severance benefits (termination benefits and non-compete benefits) may not exceed two years' worth of actual compensation (fixed and variable).

If Christopher Guérin retired, he would be entitled to benefits under the supplementary defined contribution pension plan set up by the Group in 2019 for certain employees and corporate officers. The annual contribution paid by the Company corresponds to 20% of the Chief Executive Officer's total actual annual compensation (fixed plus variable), i.e., 300,000 euros in 2024.

## Note 32 - Disputes and contingent liabilities

### A. Antitrust investigations

In January 2009, antitrust investigations were launched in several countries against various cable manufacturers including Group companies in relation to alleged anticompetitive behavior in the submarine and underground high-voltage power cables sector.

On April 7, 2014, Nexans France SAS and the Company were notified of the European Commission's decision (EC Decision), which found that Nexans France SAS had participated directly in an infringement of European antitrust legislation in the submarine and underground high-voltage power cable sector. The Company was held jointly liable for the payment of a portion of the fine imposed on Nexans France SAS by the European Commission.

In early July 2014, Nexans France SAS paid 70.6 million euro fine imposed on it by the European Commission.

*The audit procedures were carried out and the Statutory Auditors' report is being issued at the date of the publication.*

Subsequently, certain Group entities have received claims from customers filed before the courts in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany and Italy against Nexans and other defendants relating to the EC Decision.

In the United Kingdom, National Grid, Scottish Power and Vattenfall brought proceedings against Prysmian. Contribution claims were brought by Prysmian against the Company in these cases. Prysmian have now reached a settlement with each of these claimants. The contribution claims in respect of these claims are still pending but are not currently being pursued.

In May 2019, an application for a collective proceedings order was lodged in the UK before the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) by Ms Spottiswoode CBE seeking authorization to bring an action for damages on behalf of certain individuals against Nexans, Prysmian and NKT based on the EC Decision. Ms Spottiswoode claim was certified by the CAT (subject to various conditions) in May 2022 on an "opt-out" basis. She has secured financing from a professional third-party litigation funder. As part of its assessment the CAT will scrutinize the funding agreement to determine inter alia whether the proposed defendants costs would be sufficiently covered in the event that the claimant is unsuccessful in the claim. The Company is defending the claim and a hearing on one aspect of the claim is to be heard in April 2024.

In July 2022, London Array Limited and others commenced a claim in the CAT against Nexans France SAS and the Company in relation to the EC Decision. Nexans France SAS and the Company are defending the claim, which is scheduled for trial in April-May 2024.

In April 2019, Terna S.p.A. launched an antitrust damages claim against Nexans Italia before the Court of Milan based on the EC Decision. Nexans Italia filed a defense in October 2019 focusing on Nexans Italia's lack of standing to be sued. Nexans is defending the claim and a final outcome is not expected before the end of 2024 or 2025.

In April 2019, a claim in Netherlands was made jointly by Electricity & Water Authority of Bahrain, Gulf Cooperation Council Interconnection Authority, Kuwait Ministry of Electricity and Water and Oman Electricity Transmission Company against certain companies of the Prysmian Group and its former shareholders, and companies in the Nexans Group and ABB Group.

This action has been brought before the Court of Amsterdam. In December 2019, Nexans and other defendants filed a motion contesting jurisdiction, in which the defendants were successful. The court issued its judgment in November 2020, declaring itself incompetent with regard to the claims against the non-Dutch defendants, including the non-Dutch subsidiaries of the Company. The court also ordered the claimants to pay the costs of the proceedings. The claimants appealed this ruling and the matter has since been referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) for a ruling. A hearing before the ECJ was held in January 2024 and the judgment is awaited.

In November 2017, in Spain, Nexans Iberia and the Company (in its capacity as Nexans Iberia's parent company) were notified of a decision by the Spanish competition authority ("CNMC") which found that Nexans Iberia had participated directly in an infringement of Spanish competition laws in the low and medium voltage cable sectors. The Company was held jointly liable for the payment of part of the fine levied on Nexans Iberia by the CNMC. In January 2018, Nexans Iberia settled the 1.3 million euro fine levied by the CNMC. Nexans Iberia and the Company have appealed the CNMC's decision.

In July 2020 one claim was filed by Iberdrola, followed by four other Spanish claimants in 2022. All claims against Nexans Iberia are based on the CNMC decision in the low/medium voltage case. Nexans is defending these cases.

In January and May 2016, the German Federal Cartel Office (FCO) carried out searches at three of Nexans's sites in Germany. These searches are part of an investigation into cable manufacturers concerning alleged coordination of industry-standard metal surcharges in Germany. The FCO also conducted inspections at the premises of other companies in Germany. Nexans successfully challenged the validity of the search. However, the investigation is ongoing and in February, and July 2018, the FCO carried out searches at other sites in Germany and in France.

In October 2020, Saudi Electricity Company (SEC) brought a claim in Germany against Nexans S.A. and other companies including NKT and Prysmian based on the EC Decision. Nexans did not supply any power cables to SEC and is defending the claim, and in June 2024 succeeded in asking the court to require SEC to provide substantial security if it wished to continue its claim.

An investigation in Brazil by the General Superintendence of the antitrust authority "CADE" in the high-voltage power cable sector was concluded in February 2015. In April 2020, the Administrative Tribunal of CADE fined the Company, together with other cable manufacturers. The Company has paid the 1 million euro (BRL equivalent) fine but has appealed the decision. The case is ongoing.
